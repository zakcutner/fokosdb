## 2. Overview and Context

FokosDB stores items in `PartitionDO` (`packages/fokosdb/src/server/do-partition.ts`). One class does two jobs.
It is the FokosDB data partition: items, conditions, TTL, and the 2PC participant. It is also the sharding
runtime for that partition: identity, routing, topology caches, splits, key promotion, migration, and alarms.

The two jobs are mixed by hand in every RPC method. Each method repeats `ensurePartitionContext`,
`ensureMigration`, and `withSplitForwarding` or `groupItemsByRouting`. The sharding code reads FokosDB SQL rows:
items, pending transactions, deletion watermarks, key-size estimates, promoted keys, and the range hierarchy.
The audit in `gptsol-existing-behavior.md` counts 26 RPC methods that each carry this boilerplate, and lists 17
limitations that come from the mixed design (section 24 of that document).

The sharding part is valuable on its own. Any Durable Object that must grow past one object needs the same
things: deterministic identity, routing that survives splits, a durable cutover, resumable data migration,
and one alarm that drives many jobs. Today none of this is reusable. A refactor of `PartitionDO` alone does
not fix that, because the boundary between the two jobs does not exist in the code.

This document defines `FokosPartitionRuntime`. It is an object that any Durable Object class creates in its
constructor. The class gives the runtime a small set of callbacks and delegates a fixed set of `fokos`-prefixed
RPC methods to it. The runtime owns every topology transition and every forwarding decision. The class keeps
its storage, its RPC surface, and its data semantics.

## 3. Goals and Requirements

### In scope

- A host class creates one runtime in its constructor and implements `FokosPartitionHooks`. No base class is
  needed. A host that extends another base class, for example the Agents SDK, can use the runtime.
- The runtime owns identity, owner resolution, forwarding order, caches, repartition state, migration
  scheduling, acknowledgements, and the Durable Object alarm. The host cannot bypass a transition.
- The host owns its storage schema, its RPC types, its local operation semantics, its admission policy, its
  split policy, its migration data, and its own background jobs.
- The runtime does not import or know any FokosDB type: no item row, no pending transaction, no watermark, no
  key-size estimate, no TTL, no coordinator ID.
- The five operation shapes in use today are supported: point, grouped fan-out, single-owner, ordered range scan,
  and local-only control.
- Every invariant in section 17 of `gptsol-existing-behavior.md` holds. Section 5.2.18 lists each one with its
  mechanism.
- The limitations in section 24 of the same audit that are control-plane defects are fixed, not preserved:
  implicit hash ownership (24.3), acknowledgement crash gap (24.5), non-durable import start (24.6), promotion
  and split queue window (24.7), overlapping background passes (24.12), direct read-through trust (24.13),
  partial context comparison (24.14), acknowledgement membership (24.15).
- All RPC methods the host must expose for the runtime are prefixed with `fokos`.
- FokosDB `PartitionDO` is rewritten as a host of the runtime and passes its existing test suites.

### Out of scope

- A base Durable Object class. It can come later as sugar over the runtime. Nothing in this design needs it.
- Compatibility with partitions that the current `PartitionDO` created. Deployments start fresh
  (section 5.2.23). A converter and a staged dual-write upgrade were considered and dropped as not needed.
- Changes to the FokosDB public client API or to the transaction coordinator protocol.
- A pluggable ownership strategy in the public API. The runtime ships the hash tree and the range tree as
  built-in strategies behind one internal contract. Making that contract public is a later decision.
- A Worker-side cache of the live split tree. The Worker still enters through a root partition.
- A live topology keeper Durable Object. The design stays decentralized.

### Requirements

- The runtime uses `ctx.storage.kv` and `ctx.storage.sql` of the host. It writes only keys under the prefix
  `__fokos/` and tables under the prefix `fokos_`. The host must not read or write those.
- Every state transition of the runtime is one `ctx.storage.transactionSync` call. In-memory mirrors update
  inside the same call.
- One serialized RPC message must stay under 32 MiB
  ([Workers RPC limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/rpc/#limitations)). The default
  migration page budget is 20 MiB, the value in use today.
- One KV key and value together must stay under 2 MB
  ([Durable Objects limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/platform/limits/)). Every KV
  snapshot the runtime writes has a byte budget below that.
- Each Durable Object has one alarm
  ([Alarms API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/alarms/)). The runtime reaches it through a
  scheduler adapter. With the default adapter the runtime owns the alarm and the host delegates `alarm()`. A
  host whose base class already owns the alarm, for example the Agents SDK, supplies an adapter that merges
  deadlines and calls `runtime.runDueWork()` from the shared handler.
- Workers RPC preserves the `name`, the `message`, and the serializable own properties of an error, and
  drops its prototype ([RPC error handling](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/rpc/error-handling/);
  enhanced error serialization is the default for compatibility dates on or after `2026-04-21`, and both
  wrangler projects use `2026-05-23`). Every runtime error is a `FokosError` from `shared/errors.ts` and is
  recognizable from its own properties `_tag`, `code`, and `error_id`, never from `instanceof` or from its message.
- The host cannot receive constructor parameters through RPC. Shard group topology and host policy travel with
  every request, as today, so a Worker can choose them at run time per shard group and per tenant. Root hash
  partitions bootstrap from the first request. Range partitions and non-root hash partitions are created only
  by `fokosInit`.
- The runtime must not read any field of the host policy. It stores and forwards it as an opaque value.

## 4. Milestones

Each milestone is a separate change that builds and passes tests on its own.

1. **Foundation.** Package skeleton, `FokosRouteContext`, `FokosTopology`, partition ID codec (moved from
   `partition-id.ts`), errors, envelope, and the Worker-side `FokosRouter`. Unit tests only.
2. **Dispatch.** Runtime constructor, identity bootstrap, lifecycle gate, owner resolution, the point,
   group, single-owner, and local-execute shapes, and the built-in caches moved from `hash-topology.ts`,
   `partial-range-topology.ts`, and the `range_hierarchy` logic. Tested with a small example host that stores one
   SQL table and has no FokosDB dependency.
3. **Repartition.** The repartition state machine, migration loop, scheduler, and the control-plane RPCs.
   Hash split first, then range split, then key promotion. The example host gains export and import hooks.
4. **Scan.** The ordered range traversal shape.
5. **FokosDB host.** `PartitionDO` becomes a host. `PartitionStore` keeps the FokosDB tables and drops the
   sharding tables. The suites in section 25 of `gptsol-existing-behavior.md` pass. Old code is deleted.

## 5. Proposed Solution

### 5.1 High-level overview

The host class creates a runtime, tells it how to reach other partitions, and gives it callbacks. Every public
RPC method of the host becomes one call to `runtime.dispatch`. The runtime validates identity, applies the
lifecycle gate, resolves the owner of each key, runs the host's local handler or forwards to another partition,
learns caches, and returns an envelope around the host's result.

                                                      other partitions of the same class
```

The runtime has one control-plane concept, the **repartition**. A hash split, a range split, and a key promotion
are three kinds of the same plan: select ownership on a source, create targets, cut routing over, migrate data,
collect acknowledgements, and clean the source. The host sees the plan through a few hooks. The runtime keeps
every durable stage.

Migration is one loop. The target asks the source for a page with an opaque cursor. The host exports the page on
the source and imports it on the target. The runtime checkpoints the cursor after each import and repeats until
the host returns no cursor. The host encodes its own phases in the cursor. The runtime never sees a row type.

One scheduler drives all background work through the Durable Object alarm, by default directly and otherwise
through a host adapter that shares the alarm with another owner. The runtime registers its own jobs. The host
registers its jobs, for example TTL expiry. Each job runs one bounded, idempotent step and reports when it wants
to run next.

A reader who stops here knows the design: one runtime object, one dispatch call per RPC, one repartition state
machine, one migration loop, one scheduler, and `fokos`-prefixed RPC methods that the host delegates.

### 5.2 Technical details

#### 5.2.1 Integration model

The runtime is an owned object, not a base class and not a decorator.

- The host creates it in the constructor, before any other work, so its `blockConcurrencyWhile` runs first.
- The host implements the `FokosPartitionRpc` interface (section 5.2.15) with one-line delegations.
- The host calls `runtime.dispatch(operationName, ref, request)` from each public RPC method.
- The host reads `runtime.identity()` and `runtime.lifecycle()` when it needs partition facts.
- The host signals work with `runtime.requestSplitEvaluation()` and `runtime.requestPromotion(hashKey)`.

The host must not call a private method of another partition and must not resolve a stub for a control-plane
call. With the default scheduler the host must not call `setAlarm`. The runtime is the only code that creates
stubs for `fokos*` methods. The host creates stubs only inside its `forward` callbacks, and only for its own
application RPC methods.

```ts
type MyPolicy = { ns: keyof Env; maxSizeMb: number };

export class MyPartitionDO extends DurableObject<Env> implements FokosPartitionRpc {
	readonly fokos: FokosPartitionRuntime<MyPolicy, MyCursor, MyPage>;

	constructor(ctx: DurableObjectState, env: Env) {
		super(ctx, env);
		this.fokos = new FokosPartitionRuntime({
			ctx,
			// The Worker names the binding inside the policy; the class does not need to know it.
			namespace: (routeCtx) => env[routeCtx.policy.ns] as DurableObjectNamespace,
			hooks: new MyHooks(ctx.storage, () => this.fokos.policy()),
			operations: myOperations(this),
		});
		void ctx.blockConcurrencyWhile(async () => this.runMyMigrations());
	}

	putItem(routeCtx: FokosRouteContext<MyPolicy>, req: PutReq): Promise<FokosEnvelope<PutRes>> {
		return this.fokos.dispatch("putItem", routeCtx, req);
	}

	fokosInit(req: FokosInitRequest) { return this.fokos.fokosInit(req); }
	fokosStartImport() { return this.fokos.fokosStartImport(); }
	fokosMigrationPull(req: FokosPullRequest) { return this.fokos.fokosMigrationPull(req); }
	fokosMigrationAck(req: FokosAckRequest) { return this.fokos.fokosMigrationAck(req); }
	fokosExecuteLocal(req: FokosExecuteLocalRequest) { return this.fokos.fokosExecuteLocal(req); }
	fokosStatus(routeCtx?: FokosRouteContext<MyPolicy>) { return this.fokos.fokosStatus(routeCtx); }
	fokosDestroy() { return this.fokos.fokosDestroy(); }
	alarm(info: AlarmInvocationInfo) { return this.fokos.alarm(info); }
}
```

#### 5.2.2 Identity, topology, policy, and the route context

A Durable Object cannot receive parameters at construction, and a library host such as FokosDB does not know at
build time which shard groups exist, how many roots each one has, or under which binding name the user attached
the class. The Worker decides all of that at request time. A Worker can give a paid tenant more root partitions
than a free tenant, with no code change in the Durable Object.

Every application request therefore carries a **route context**. It has four parts with three lifetimes.

```ts
type FokosRouteContext<TPolicy> = {
	schema: 1;
	/** Immutable identity of the target partition. */
	partitionId: string; // hex-encoded opaque bytes, same wire format as PartitionIdHelper today
	doName: string;      // `<shardGroup>.h.<root>[.<child>...]` or `<shardGroup>.r.<hk>.<start>.<end>`
	/** Immutable topology of the shard group. Persisted at creation. A later mismatch is an error. */
	topology: FokosTopology;
	/** Range-split parameters the runtime reads when it plans a range split. Mutable, last writer wins. */
	rangeConfig: FokosRangeConfig;
	/** Host policy. Opaque to the runtime. Persisted and replaced when a request carries a new value. */
	policy: TPolicy;
};

type FokosTopology = {
	shardGroup: string;
	rootTreesN: number;
	hashSplitN: number;
};

type FokosRangeConfig = {
	/** The child count of the next range split. Range children are named by their boundaries, not by an index, so the value can change between splits. */
	rangeSplitN: number;
	/** Bounded ancestor set a new range child receives. Read once per split. */
	rangeAncestors: { fromRoot: number; fromLeaf: number };
};

type FokosPartitionRef = Pick<FokosRouteContext<unknown>, "partitionId" | "doName">;
```

| Part                       | Lifetime                       | Who sets it              | Who reads it                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `partitionId`, `doName`    | Immutable                      | Router or source         | Runtime: identity check, child derivation      |
| `topology`                 | Immutable per shard group      | Worker at first request  | Runtime: child fan-out, names, ownership       |
| `rangeConfig`              | Mutable, last writer wins      | Worker on every request  | Runtime: range split planning only             |
| `policy`                   | Mutable, last writer wins      | Worker on every request  | Host hooks only, through `runtime.policy()`    |

Only `topology` is frozen. A field that the runtime reads only when it plans a repartition is mutable, so that an
operator can change it without an outage; the plan that reads it snapshots it. Freezing `rangeSplitN` would turn a
configuration change into a `fokos_identity_mismatch` on every request of the shard group.

The runtime reads no field of `policy`. The host puts there whatever its hooks need: split thresholds, its own
namespace binding key, a coordinator binding key, tenant tier. FokosDB puts `ns`, `nsTx`, `hashSplitConditions`,
and `rangeSplitConditions` there.

**Persisted identity**, KV `__fokos/identity`, written once at bootstrap or `fokosInit`:

```ts
type FokosPartitionIdentity = {
	schema: 1;
	ref: FokosPartitionRef;
	kind: "hash" | "range";
	/** Hash: root index and child path. Range: hash key and [start, end). Decoded from ref.partitionId. */
	hash?: { rootIndex: number; path: number[] };
	range?: {
		hashKey: KeyBytes; start: KeyBytes | null; end: KeyBytes | null; depth: number;
		/** The bounded ancestor set from `fokosInit`. Immutable. The source of `route._hint.rangeAncestors`. */
		ancestors: Array<{ depth: number; start: KeyBytes; end: KeyBytes }>;
	};
	topology: FokosTopology;
};
```

**Persisted policy**, KV `__fokos/policy`, holds `{ rangeConfig, policy }`: the last values a request carried.
Background jobs read them when no request is in flight, for example `evaluateSplit` with `trigger: "background"`,
range split planning, and `cleanupSourceStep`.

Validation on each request:

1. `partitionId` and `doName` must equal the stored identity. A mismatch throws `fokos_identity_mismatch`.
2. Every field of `topology` must equal the stored topology. A mismatch throws `fokos_identity_mismatch`. The
   compare is exhaustive over the type, which closes audit 24.14.
3. `rangeConfig` and `policy` are compared structurally with the stored values. When either differs, the runtime
   validates the `rangeConfig` bounds, then writes both in one `transactionSync` before it runs the operation.
   Equal values cost one compare and no write.

A root hash partition without a stored identity writes identity, range config, and policy from the first valid
route context. Any other partition without a stored identity throws `fokos_not_initialized`; only `fokosInit`
creates it.

A target created by `fokosInit` receives its full route context from the source: the source derives the child
`partitionId` and `doName`, copies its own `topology`, and copies its current stored `rangeConfig` and `policy`.
All three therefore flow from the Worker to the roots and from each source to its targets. No partition needs a
constructor parameter.

The runtime validates topology bounds at bootstrap and on every `fokosInit`, and range config bounds on every
write of `__fokos/policy`, and throws `fokos_invalid_topology` otherwise. The bounds come from the partition ID
codec: `rootTreesN` is 1 to 65,535 (`u16` root index), `hashSplitN` and `rangeSplitN` are 2 to 255 (`u8` child
index), `shardGroup` is non-empty and contains no `.`.

The policy compare is structural in this version. A `version` field that the host bumps, with a validation hook
on change, can be added later without a wire change, because `policy` is already opaque.

`rootTreesN` and `hashSplitN` must never change for an existing shard group. The runtime detects a change only
when a request reaches a partition that already exists; a root index that did not exist before bootstraps as
a fresh partition. The Worker must persist its topology choice per shard group. This is the same contract as
today.

The `primaryDoIdStr` field is dropped. The name is deterministic and `idFromName` recreates the ID. The
`PartitionIdHelper` codec moves into the runtime package unchanged.

**Runtime tuning**, a constructor option. These values do not change routing or ownership, so they can be code:

```ts
type FokosRuntimeOptions<TPolicy> = {
	/**
	 * The binding of the host's own class, resolved from a route context. The host stores its binding
	 * key inside `policy` when it does not know it at build time. Called for every stub the runtime creates.
	 */
	namespace(ctx: FokosRouteContext<TPolicy>): DurableObjectNamespace;
	caches?: {
		hashArenaBytes?: number;
		rangeHierarchyMaxRows?: number;
		promotionBloom?: { expectedKeys: number; falsePositiveRate: number } | false;
	};
	migration?: { pageBudgetBytes?: number; initRetries?: number };
	scheduler?: {
		fallbackAlarmMs?: number;
		fastPathDelayMs?: number;
		/** Default: `fokosNativeAlarmScheduler(ctx)`, which owns the Durable Object alarm. Section 5.2.14. */
		adapter?: FokosScheduler;
	};
};
```

When the runtime needs a stub outside a request, for example in a background job, it calls `namespace` with its
own stored route context, which the host policy inside it makes sufficient.

#### 5.2.3 Persisted state owned by the runtime

The runtime loads identity, policy, the import record, the repartition rows, the route overrides, and the cache
snapshots into memory inside `blockConcurrencyWhile` in its constructor. All later reads of this state are
in-memory. All writes go through `transactionSync` and update the memory mirror in the same call.

Repartition rows are permanent routing rules. A completed hash split makes the source a router forever. A
completed promotion sends one hash key to a range tree forever. Only progress fields are cleared.

```

Rules for hooks:

- `evaluateSplit`, `computeRangeBoundaries`, `importPage`, `beforeCutover`, `beforeComplete`, and `admit` are
  synchronous. Four of them run inside a `transactionSync`. An `await` there is a defect.
- `exportPage`, `finalizeImport`, `cleanupSourceStep`, and `onLifecycleEvent` can be async. None of them
  writes owned data on a path that a cutover can race, so they take no lease.
- A hook that receives a `plan` reads `plan.policy`, the snapshot from queue time. A long migration or cleanup
  therefore sees one policy from start to end. A hook without a plan calls `runtime.policy()`, the live value
  that the last request updated.
- A hook must not throw to express a policy result. It returns the result. A thrown error is a defect and the
  runtime logs it, keeps durable state unchanged, and retries on the next background pass.
- `importPage` must be idempotent. The runtime commits the page and the cursor in one transaction, but the host
  cursor is opaque, so two pages can legitimately overlap at a phase boundary.

#### 5.2.5 Operation descriptors

The host registers each application operation once. The runtime uses the descriptor for dispatch, for
read-through during import, and for stale-transaction style recovery that the host runs through
`dispatch`. A registry replaces the current per-call closures so that `fokosExecuteLocal` (section 5.2.13)
can find the local handler by name.

```ts
type FokosOperationBase<Req, Res> = {
	/**
	 * "retry": while this partition imports, throw `fokos_importing` (retryable).
	 * "read_source": while this partition imports, run the same operation locally on the source partition.
	 */
	whileMigrating: "retry" | "read_source";
	/**
	 * The operation never writes partitioned data. Required for `whileMigrating: "read_source"`: the source
	 * runs the handler on a router after cutover, and a write there is lost. The constructor throws
	 * `fokos_operation_invalid` for a `read_source` descriptor without it.
	 */
	readOnly?: boolean;
	/** Opaque to the runtime. Passed to hooks.admit. */
	admissionTag?: string;
	/**
	 * How `local` interacts with a routing cutover. Section 5.2.20. Default "sync".
	 * "sync":      `local` must return a value, not a thenable. Nothing can interleave, so no guard is needed.
	 * "lease":     `local` can be async. The runtime holds a shared lease across it; cutover drains holders.
	 * "unguarded": `local` can be async and the host owns the safety of that choice.
	 */

| Shape          | Owner resolution                              | Behavior                                                                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `point`        | One key                                       | Local, or forward to one partition. Learns caches from the envelope.      |
| `group`        | Every item                                    | Local group plus one group per remote partition. Host merges.             |
| `single_owner` | Every item                                    | Exactly one destination. Otherwise throw `fokos_single_owner_fallback`.   |
| `scan`         | Hash key to a leaf, then ordered range visit  | Visits intersecting range children in order until `fold` stops.           |
| `local`        | None                                          | Never forwarded, never gated. Used by `fokosExecuteLocal` and by admin.   |

`single_owner` throws instead of returning a host value. The error has no side effects and passes unchanged
through every forwarding hop, so the caller runs its multi-partition path. This is the behavior of
`errSinglePartitionFastPathFallback` today.

A `group` operation on a partition that is a router has an empty local group. The host `merge` receives zero
or more parts and one part per remote target.

#### 5.2.6 The dispatch pipeline

`dispatch` runs these steps in this order. The order is the contract from section 21 of the audit.

1. **Identity.** Validate identity and topology, store a changed policy, or bootstrap a root (section 5.2.2).
2. **Lifecycle gate.** If `import.state` is `awaiting_data` or `importing`, the runtime first schedules
   `target_import` on the fast path and moves the fallback alarm to `now + fallbackAlarmMs` when that is
   earlier, so a request can restart an import whose `fokosStartImport` trigger was lost. Then:
   - state `awaiting_data` → throw `fokos_not_owner_yet` for every shape. The target has not imported a page,
     so it cannot know that the source has cut over, and the source may still own the key.
   - state `importing` and `whileMigrating: "read_source"` → run owner resolution step 1 (ownership) for the
     keys of the request and throw `fokos_out_of_range` on a miss; then call
     `source.fokosExecuteLocal({ op, request, caller: selfRef })`, add one to `forwardCount`, return
     (section 5.2.13). The gate runs before owner resolution steps 2 to 4, so the target does not apply its own
     route overrides here. The source applies them for the key (section 5.2.13, step 3).
   - state `importing` and `whileMigrating: "retry"` → throw `fokos_importing`.
   The states `imported` and `active` pass the gate. The data is complete.
3. **Owner resolution** for every key (section 5.2.7). Group the items by destination.
4. **Admission.** If a local group exists, call `hooks.admit`. A rejection throws the host error unchanged.
5. **Execution.** Run the local group and the remote groups per the shape. Remote groups run in parallel.
   The local call follows the operation's `localConcurrency` mode (section 5.2.20).
6. **Learning.** For each successful remote envelope, learn the route (section 5.2.9), add one to
   `forwardCount`.
7. **Signals.** If the local group succeeded and the descriptor has `afterLocalSuccess`, collect signals and
   apply them (section 5.2.11). An error here is logged and does not change the result.
8. **Envelope.** Return the result wrapped for a local result, or the merged remote envelope.

The `awaiting_data` distinction in step 2 exists because a target is initialized before the source cuts over.
Until the target imports its first page it does not know that it owns anything. A speculative caller that
receives `fokos_not_owner_yet` treats it as a false positive (section 5.2.7). Every other caller, including a
source that has cut over, passes the error up unchanged: the runtime never retries inside a request, and the
error is retryable, so the Worker retries as it retries `partition_migrating` today. The window is the time
between the cutover and the first imported page, which the fast-path schedule above and `fokosStartImport` keep
short.

#### 5.2.7 Owner resolution

One function resolves a route key to an owner. Every shape uses it.

```ts
type FokosOwner =
	| { kind: "local" }
	| { kind: "remote"; target: FokosPartitionRef; speculative: boolean }
	| { kind: "out_of_range" };
```

Resolution order on a hash partition:

1. **Ownership.** The hash key must hash to `identity.hash.rootIndex` with `rootTreesN`, and at each depth `d`
   of `identity.hash.path` it must hash to `path[d]` with `hashSplitN`. Otherwise `out_of_range`. This is one
   hash per level, in memory, and it turns a routing defect into an error instead of a write on the wrong
   partition (audit 24.3).
2. **Route override.** If `fokos_route_overrides` has the hash key and the repartition state is `cutover` or
   later, the owner is the promotion target: the range root, or a deeper range slice from the range hierarchy
   cache. This is authoritative.
3. **Promotion Bloom cache.** If the filter reports a probable promotion by a descendant, the owner is the
   range root, `speculative: true`. Point and scan shapes use this step. Group and single-owner shapes skip it.
4. **Topology.** If this partition is a router (`sourceAfterCutover: "router"` on a `cutover` or later
   repartition), pick the child by the hash function at this depth, then apply the hash arena cache to jump
   deeper. Otherwise the owner is local.

Resolution order on a range partition:

1. **Ownership.** The hash key must equal `identity.range.hashKey`, and the sort key must be inside
   `[start, end)`. Otherwise `out_of_range`.
2. If this partition is a router, pick the child whose interval contains the sort key, then apply the range
   hierarchy cache to jump deeper. Otherwise the owner is local.

A speculative forward that fails with `fokos_not_initialized` or `fokos_not_owner_yet` resolves again with the
Bloom step disabled. Any other error propagates.

`out_of_range` throws `fokos_out_of_range`. It is a routing defect, not backpressure. Both partition kinds now
verify ownership; a caller that reaches the wrong partition gets an error rather than a silent misplacement.

The `belongsToTarget` predicate that `exportPage` receives is the same function as hash step 4 for hash children
and range step 2 for range children, with one addition for hash children: a key with a `completed` or `cleaned`
route override returns `false`, because a range tree owns it. One implementation, two callers.

#### 5.2.8 Response envelope

The runtime wraps every result. Application response types do not carry routing fields.

```ts
type FokosEnvelope<T> = {
	value: T;
	route: {
		servedBy: FokosPartitionRef;
		hashDepth: number;
		rangeDepth: number;
		forwardCount: number;
		/** Internal. Bounded ancestor boundaries of a range leaf. Consumers must drop it. */
		_hint?: { rangeAncestors: Array<{ depth: number; start: KeyBytes; end: KeyBytes }> };
	};
};
```

A forwarding partition keeps `servedBy`, `hashDepth`, `rangeDepth`, and `_hint` from the child envelope and
adds one to `forwardCount`. The `forward` callback of an operation must return the envelope of the remote
call unchanged. The Worker-side `FokosRouter.unwrap(envelope)` returns `value` and a public route summary
without `_hint`.

An error follows the same rule as a result. The partition that raises an error attaches its `route` as an own
data property of the error, as `stampRoutingMeta` does today; own properties cross the RPC hop. A forwarding
partition learns from `error.route` as it learns from a result envelope, adds one to `forwardCount`, and
rethrows the same error object. A partition without an identity attaches nothing.

Because every shape returns an envelope, transaction operations learn routes from their own fan-out. This
removes limitation 24.11 of the audit.

#### 5.2.9 Route caches

Caches are hints. A miss, a full cache, a stale entry, or a disabled cache changes latency only. Ownership is
decided by the route override table and the topology, never by a cache.

| Cache                | Storage                          | Learns from                                     | Bound                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Hash arena           | KV `__fokos/cache/hash_arena`    | `route.hashDepth` of a forwarded envelope       | `caches.hashArenaBytes`, depth cap |
| Range hierarchy      | SQL `fokos_range_hierarchy`      | `route._hint.rangeAncestors`                    | `caches.rangeHierarchyMaxRows`     |
| Promotion Bloom      | KV `__fokos/cache/promotion_bloom` | A hash partition forwarded and `servedBy` is a range partition | filter size, no removal |

The range hierarchy table holds learned rows only and gains a row bound, which the current `range_hierarchy`
table lacks (audit 24.10). A learn writes or refreshes `learned_at`. When full, the runtime evicts the rows with
the oldest `learned_at`, deepest first. A partition's own ancestors are not in this table: `fokosInit` writes
them into the identity, so eviction cannot change `route._hint.rangeAncestors` (audit 24.9). The cache
implementations move from `hash-topology.ts` and `partial-range-topology.ts` with their tests. They sit behind
one internal contract: `lookup(key)`, `learn(key, envelope)`, `invalidate(key, target)`. The contract is not
public in this version.

#### 5.2.10 Repartition state machine

One state machine serves hash splits, range splits, and key promotions.

**Source side** — `fokos_repartitions.state`:

Only a `key_promotion` reaches `abandoned`, and section 5.2.11 gives the rule.

A range split whose `computeRangeBoundaries` returns `null` stays `queued` and retries on the next pass with
exponential backoff from `fallbackAlarmMs` up to 5 minutes. A promotion whose `beforeCutover` returns `false`
stays `queued` and retries every `fallbackAlarmMs` with no backoff: each attempt samples one instant for a
lock-free key, and while the promotion is `queued` the leaf cannot queue a hash split (section 5.2.11), so a
slower sampling rate lets the leaf reach its size cap and reject every write. Targets that a failed start
created stay `awaiting_data`, and the next start reuses them; `fokosInit` is idempotent for the same
`(repartitionId, target)`. Open question 5.3.8 covers the range split, whose targets are not deterministic
across attempts.

**Target side** — KV `__fokos/import`:

```

```

The `imported` state is new. Today the child writes `migration_completed` and then acknowledges; a crash
between the two leaves the parent in `split_started` forever (audit 24.5). Here the `target_ack` job retries
until the source confirms. The target's own fallback alarm from `fokosInit` starts the import even when the
source's `fokosStartImport` trigger is lost (audit 24.6).

#### 5.2.11 Arbitration between repartitions

All arbitration runs inside one `transactionSync` that reads the repartition rows and writes the decision. This
closes the queue window of audit 24.7.

| Request                       | Accepted when                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| queue `hash_split`            | Partition kind is `hash`, no split row is `queued` or `cutover`, and no `key_promotion` row is `cutover` |
| queue `range_split`           | Partition kind is `range`, and no row is `queued` or `cutover`                                 |
| queue `key_promotion`         | Partition kind is `hash`, no `hash_split` row exists in any state, and no override for the key  |
| cut over `key_promotion`      | No `hash_split` row exists in any state, and `beforeCutover` returned true                      |
| cut over a split              | `beforeCutover` returned true or is undefined                                                   |

A `key_promotion` row in `queued` does not block a hash split. The `queued` state carries no routing decision,
so the source still owns every key. A `queued` promotion that blocks a split starves it: `beforeCutover` can
refuse every attempt, for example because the hash key holds a transaction lock on each sample, and the leaf
then reaches its size cap and rejects every write.

A `key_promotion` row in `cutover` does block a hash split. The range tree already owns the key, and
`belongsToTarget` excludes a key only from a `completed` or a `cleaned` override, so a hash child would receive a
second copy of the data of that key.

A `hash_split` row in any state blocks a promotion, in both directions. A router owns no row, so a promotion
from it copies a stale snapshot and then shadows the live data of the child.

Because of these two rules, a split can complete while a `key_promotion` row is still `queued`. The completion
transaction of the split sets that row to `abandoned` and deletes its override row. An `abandoned` row decides
no route, drives no job, and blocks nothing. It keeps its target rows, so `fokosStatus().links` still reports a
range root that `fokosInit` created before the split, and `FokosRouter.walk` can destroy it. The child that
owns the hash key queues its own promotion when its next signal names the key, and `fokosInit` takes over the
range root of the abandoned plan (section 5.2.15).

A `key_promotion` row in `completed` or `cleaned` never blocks anything.

Signals arrive from `afterLocalSuccess`, `requestSplitEvaluation`, and `requestPromotion`. The runtime handles a
signal in the request that produced it, after the result is fixed:

1. `evaluateSplit: true` → call `hooks.evaluateSplit({ trigger: "after_write" })`; when true, queue the split for
   this partition kind.
2. `promotionCandidates` → for each key, queue a `key_promotion` when arbitration accepts it.
3. Schedule `source_repartition` on the fast path and set the fallback alarm.

The durable queue write and the `setAlarm` call are awaited. The fast-path timer is not. A failure in this step
is logged and the request still returns its result.

A hash child inherits promotions. The runtime moves each `fokos_route_overrides` row whose hash key belongs to
a target, together with its `completed` or `cleaned` `key_promotion` row, through the runtime stream of the
migration protocol (section 5.2.12). The host's `belongsToTarget` excludes those keys, so the child receives the
forwarding pointer and no data copy. No host hook is involved.

#### 5.2.12 Migration protocol

One RPC, one loop per stream, one opaque host cursor. The runtime owns a second, small stream for its own
rows so that a hash leaf with many promoted keys never produces an unbounded init request.

```ts
type FokosPullRequest<TCursor> = {
	repartitionId: string;
	target: FokosPartitionRef;
	/** "runtime": route override rows for this target. "host": the host's opaque pages. */
	stream: "runtime" | "host";
	cursor: TCursor | FokosRuntimeCursor | null;
	budgetBytes: number;
};
type FokosPullResult<TCursor, TPage> = {
	page: TPage | FokosRuntimePage;
	nextCursor: TCursor | FokosRuntimeCursor | null;
	bytes: number;
};
```

Source side, `fokosMigrationPull`:

1. The repartition row must exist, else `fokos_repartition_unknown`.
2. The target must be a member row, else `fokos_target_unknown`.
3. The state must be `cutover` or `completed`. State `queued` throws `fokos_not_owner_yet`: targets exist but the
   cutover is not durable, so the source still owns the data and must not export it.
4. `stream: "runtime"`: return the next page of override rows whose hash key belongs to the target, ordered by
   hash key, at most `budgetBytes`. Only a `hash_split` has rows here; other kinds return an empty done page.
5. `stream: "host"`: call `hooks.exportPage` with the plan, the slice, the `belongsToTarget` predicate, the
   cursor, and the budget. Return the page unchanged.

Target side, job `target_import`. The import record holds one cursor per stream.

1. Read the import record.
2. Runtime stream until done: pull, then `transactionSync`: insert the override and repartition rows, write the
   runtime cursor, on the first page set state `importing`.
3. Host stream until done: `page = source.fokosMigrationPull({ ..., stream: "host", cursor })`, then
   `transactionSync`: `hooks.importPage(page, info)`, write the host cursor, on the first page set state
   `importing`. The runtime can start the next pull before the current import completes; the cursor it uses is
   the `nextCursor` of the page it already holds.
4. `await hooks.finalizeImport(info)`.
5. `transactionSync`: state `imported`, cursors deleted.
6. Schedule `target_ack`.

Any error stops the loop and keeps the record as is. `fokos_not_owner_yet` from the source means the cutover is
not durable yet; the loop reschedules at `fallbackAlarmMs` with no backoff, so the import starts within one
interval of the cutover even when `fokosStartImport` is lost. Any other error reschedules with exponential
backoff from `fallbackAlarmMs` up to 5 minutes. A request that reaches the gate also schedules the job on the
fast path (section 5.2.6). A resume starts strictly after the last committed cursor of the stream that was
running. The host encodes phases inside its cursor and page.
For FokosDB that is `items → pending transactions and watermark`. The runtime does not know these names, and
FokosDB no longer migrates promoted keys itself.

The default `budgetBytes` is 20 MiB. The host must return a page whose serialized size is at or below the
budget. The runtime does not measure it. The RPC layer rejects a message above 32 MiB, and the runtime treats
that as a page error and retries with half the budget, down to 1 MiB.

#### 5.2.13 Read-through during import

An operation with `whileMigrating: "read_source"` runs on the source while the target is `importing`. The
descriptor must declare `readOnly: true` (section 5.2.5); the constructor rejects the combination otherwise.
The target first runs owner resolution step 1 for the keys of the request (section 5.2.6), then calls
`source.fokosExecuteLocal({ op, request, caller })`. The source:

1. Validates that `caller` is a member target of one of its repartitions. An unknown caller gets
   `fokos_target_unknown`. A member of a repartition that is still `queued` gets `fokos_not_owner_yet`: the
   source owns the data and the caller must not serve it. The states `cutover` and `completed` pass.
2. Finds the operation by name. It must exist and be `readOnly`; otherwise `fokos_operation_invalid`.
3. Extracts the keys with the descriptor (`key`, `items`, or `scan`) and tests each one with the
   `belongsToTarget` predicate of the caller's slice. A key outside the slice throws `fokos_out_of_range`,
   with one exception below. This closes audit 24.13 for the key, not only for the caller.

   The exception is a hash key that a route override moved. `belongsToTarget` of a `hash_child` slice returns
   false for it, because a range tree owns it, and the source must not answer it from its own rows. The source
   resolves the owner of that key (section 5.2.7, step 2), forwards the request with the `forward` callback of
   the operation, and returns that envelope. It does not throw. Without this rule a read of a promoted key fails
   with `fokos_out_of_range`, which no caller retries, for the whole import of the hash child. A caller reaches
   the importing child for such a key when a hash arena cache of an ancestor holds a deeper hint and the
   promotion Bloom cache of that ancestor holds no entry for the key.
4. Runs the `local` handler without owner resolution and without the lifecycle gate, under the operation's
   `localConcurrency` mode. `admit` and `afterLocalSuccess` do not run: the source serves a copy, it does not
   take a decision about it.
5. Returns the result in an envelope with the source's own `route`.

The target does not return that envelope as is. It replaces `servedBy`, `hashDepth`, and `rangeDepth` with its
own values, replaces `_hint` with its own ancestors, and adds one to `forwardCount`. An answer that the source
forwarded to an override owner is the one exception: the target keeps `servedBy` and `_hint` of that answer and
replaces the two depths only, so the caller learns the promotion in its Bloom cache and the range boundaries in
its hierarchy cache. The caller forwarded to the
target, and a cache that learns from the envelope needs the depth of the partition it reached, not the depth
of the source; today's code patches `hashDepth` for the same reason. `afterRequest` on the target reports
`handling: "read_source"`.

A source that is a router for the requested key is never reached here: the target only reads from its own
source, and the source's local storage holds the complete data for the target's slice until cleanup, which runs
only after the target is `active`.

A `scan` shape must use `read_source`, because a range child that answers with partial data would return a wrong
ordered result rather than a retryable error.

#### 5.2.14 Background scheduler

The runtime runs named jobs and reaches the Durable Object alarm through a scheduler adapter.

```ts
interface FokosScheduler {
	/** Make sure the runtime's work pass runs at or before `runAtMs`. Must not move an earlier deadline later. */
	schedule(runAtMs: number): void | Promise<void>;
	/** Remove the runtime's deadline only. Must keep deadlines that other owners set. */
	cancel(): void | Promise<void>;
}

/** Default. Owns the alarm: `schedule` is `setAlarm`, `cancel` is `deleteAlarm`. */
function fokosNativeAlarmScheduler(ctx: DurableObjectState): FokosScheduler;

type FokosJob = {
	name: string;
	/** False skips the job in this pass. Synchronous. */
	canRun(): boolean;
	/** Same contract as an operation's `localConcurrency`. Default "sync". Section 5.2.20. */
	concurrency?: "sync" | "lease" | "unguarded";
	/** One bounded, idempotent step. Under "sync" it must return a value, not a thenable. */
	runStep(): { nextRunAt: number | null } | Promise<{ nextRunAt: number | null }>;
};
```

A host job that mutates partitioned data receives an `owns(key: RouteKey): boolean` helper through
`runtime.owns`. It must check each key before it writes, because a promotion source keeps some keys and
gives others away. `canRun` alone cannot express that per key.

Built-in jobs run first, in this order: `target_import`, `target_ack`, `source_repartition`, `source_cleanup`.
Host jobs follow in registration order. FokosDB registers stale-transaction recovery and TTL expiry here and
removes its separate TTL timer.

One pass:

1. For each job with `canRun()`, run `runStep()`. Catch its error, log it, and set its next run to
   `now + fallbackAlarmMs`. One failing job never stops another.
2. Persist `__fokos/jobs` with every `nextRunAt`.
3. `scheduler.schedule(min(nextRunAt))` when any job wants to run. Otherwise `scheduler.cancel()`.

The pass is `runtime.runDueWork(info?)`. `runtime.alarm(info)` is `runDueWork` plus nothing else; it exists so
the default integration is one delegation. `runDueWork` never throws. It records a retry deadline through the
adapter instead, as the Alarms API guide recommends. The fast path is an in-memory timer of `fastPathDelayMs`
(default 50 ms) that calls the same pass. The runtime keeps one in-flight pass promise. A fast-path request or
an alarm that arrives during a pass waits for it, then runs one more pass. Two passes never interleave (audit
24.12).

A host whose base class owns `alarm()` does not delegate it. It supplies an adapter that stores the runtime
deadline next to the base class deadlines and arms the alarm with the earliest of them. Its shared `alarm()`
handler calls the base class handler and `runtime.runDueWork()`. The runtime does not depend on which one
fired the alarm: `runDueWork` runs only jobs whose `nextRunAt` has passed and re-arms through the adapter.
The Agents SDK adapter is open question 5.3.6.

`runtime.scheduleJob(name, runAt)` lets the host request an earlier run for one of its jobs. It moves
`nextRunAt` earlier only, persists, and calls `scheduler.schedule` if the earliest deadline moved.

Every job, built-in or host, must be idempotent and resumable. A crash in the middle of a step is recovered by
the next step reading durable state.

#### 5.2.15 Control-plane RPC surface

The host implements this interface by delegation. The runtime implements it too, so each host method is one
line. These are the only RPC methods the runtime calls on a peer, and the runtime is the only caller of them.

```ts
interface FokosPartitionRpc {
	/** Create this partition as a target. Idempotent for the same (repartitionId, target). */
	fokosInit(req: FokosInitRequest): Promise<void>;
	/** Best-effort fast start of the import job. */
	fokosStartImport(): Promise<void>;
	/** Source side of the migration loop. */
	fokosMigrationPull(req: FokosPullRequest<unknown>): Promise<FokosPullResult<unknown, unknown>>;
	/** Target reports a complete import. Idempotent. Validates membership. */
	fokosMigrationAck(req: { repartitionId: string; target: FokosPartitionRef }): Promise<void>;
	/** Run one registered operation locally, without routing. Authorized targets only. */
	fokosExecuteLocal(req: { op: string; request: unknown; caller: FokosPartitionRef }): Promise<FokosEnvelope<unknown>>;
	/** Queue a key promotion on the partition that owns the key now. Forwards through routers like a point operation. */
	fokosRequestPromotion(req: { hashKey: KeyBytes; data?: unknown }): Promise<FokosRequestPromotionResult>;
	/** Identity, lifecycle, outgoing links, cache statistics. Can bootstrap a root when `routeCtx` is given. */
	fokosStatus(routeCtx?: FokosRouteContext<unknown>): Promise<FokosStatus>;
	/** Call `hooks.beforeDestroy`, cancel the schedule, delete all storage, abort. The caller traverses links first. */
	fokosDestroy(): Promise<void>;
	/** Default integration only. A host with another alarm owner calls `runtime.runDueWork()` instead. */
	alarm(info: AlarmInvocationInfo): Promise<void>;
}

type FokosInitRequest<TPolicy> = {
	repartitionId: string;
	source: FokosPartitionRef;
	/** Full route context of the new partition: identity, the source's topology, the source's stored policy. */
	target: FokosRouteContext<TPolicy>;
	slice: FokosSlice;
	rangeDepth?: number;
	rangeAncestors?: Array<{ depth: number; start: KeyBytes; end: KeyBytes }>;
};

type FokosStatus = {
	identity: FokosPartitionIdentity;
	lifecycle: FokosLifecycle;
	/** Targets of every repartition in state cutover or later: split children and promotion range roots. */
	links: FokosPartitionRef[];
	repartitions: Array<{ id: string; kind: string; state: string; acknowledged: number; targets: number }>;
};
```

`fokosInit` with a conflicting existing identity throws `fokos_init_conflict`. A conflicting retry is a defect
and must not be repaired silently.

`fokosInit` with a different `(repartitionId, source)` takes the target over when the import record is still
`awaiting_data`. It rewrites the record with the new plan, the new source, and the new slice. The target holds
no page then, so it claims no ownership, and the plan that created it can no longer cut over: an abandoned
promotion (section 5.2.11) and an abandoned range-split attempt both leave a source that arbitration refuses.
An import record in `importing` or later throws `fokos_init_conflict`, because a source that cut over is
already sending its data.

Without the takeover rule a target that a failed or an abandoned plan created keeps its record forever, and the
next plan that resolves the same name can never initialize it. The name of a range partition is deterministic
from its hash key and its boundaries, so a later plan does resolve the same name.

`fokosStatus().links` gives one graph view for administration. Destruction walks `links` post-order and calls
`fokosDestroy` on each partition. The Worker does not need to know about split children and promoted keys
separately.

Debug operations of the host, for example a forced promotion, call `runtime.requestPromotion(hashKey)` from the
host's own RPC method. The runtime resolves the owner of `{ hashKey, sortKey: empty }` as a point operation
(section 5.2.7, Bloom step skipped). A route override or a range owner means the key is already promoted:
the result is `{ queued: false, owner }`. A remote hash owner receives `fokosRequestPromotion` and answers
for itself. A local owner runs arbitration (section 5.2.11). This fixes audit 24.8 with one control RPC and no
host stub.

#### 5.2.16 Worker-side router

```ts
class FokosRouter<TPolicy> {
	/** Cheap to construct. A Worker can build one per request with a tenant-specific topology and policy. */
	constructor(topology: FokosTopology, policy: TPolicy);
	rootContext(hashKey: KeyBytes): FokosRouteContext<TPolicy>;
	allRoots(): FokosRouteContext<TPolicy>[];
	unwrap<T>(envelope: FokosEnvelope<T>): { value: T; route: FokosPublicRoute };
	/** Post-order traversal over `fokosStatus().links`, starting from every root. */
	walk(
		namespace: DurableObjectNamespace,
		visit: (ctx: FokosRouteContext<TPolicy>, stub: DurableObjectStub) => Promise<void>,
	): Promise<void>;
}
```

The router hashes the hash key to a root index with the function in `router.ts` today and builds the root route
context. It caches nothing. All deeper routing happens inside partitions.

The Worker chooses `topology` and `policy` at run time. FokosDB builds the router from its table configuration,
so a caller can give one table 4 roots and another table 64 roots, and can change split thresholds without a
deployment. The only rule is the one in section 5.2.2: `rootTreesN` and `hashSplitN` must stay fixed for a shard
group that exists.

#### 5.2.17 Errors

Every runtime error is a `FokosError` from `shared/errors.ts`, defined with `defineCodes`. That module imports
nothing, so the runtime package can depend on it without reaching FokosDB. Retryable codes are in the category
`FokosUnavailableError` (origin `service`, hint 503); every other code is in `FokosRoutingError` (origin
`internal`, hint 500). The message carries the `fokos/<code>: ` prefix that the constructor adds. Own
properties cross the RPC hop and the prototype does not, so hosts and clients match with `FokosError.isCode`
and never with `instanceof`. The codes below are the internal contract between partitions; section 5.2.22
says how FokosDB keeps its public codes.

| Code                          | Retryable | Meaning                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fokos_not_initialized`       | no        | Non-root partition has no identity. Speculative callers fall back.         |

#### 5.2.20 Concurrency

A Durable Object runs one JavaScript thread, but `await` points interleave requests, alarms, and the fast-path
pass. The runtime keeps correctness with three rules:

1. Every durable transition is one `transactionSync` with no `await` inside. Hooks that run inside are
   synchronous by contract.
2. The in-memory mirror changes only inside the same `transactionSync`. A request that runs after the `await`
   sees either the old or the new state, never a mix.
3. One scheduler pass at a time. Overlapping requests coalesce into one more pass.

Remote fan-out inside a group operation runs with `Promise.all` for `fail_fast` and `Promise.allSettled` for
`attempt_all`. Migration pulls are sequential per target with one page of prefetch.

**The cutover race.** One interleaving can break ownership: a request resolves "local owner", its `local`
handler awaits non-storage I/O (`fetch`, an RPC, a timer), a background pass writes the cutover, and the
handler resumes and writes to the old source. The only yield points inside a Durable Object are such awaits.
SQLite storage is synchronous, and async KV storage closes the input gate. A `local` handler that never
awaits between owner resolution and its durable write therefore cannot hit the race.

`ctx.blockConcurrencyWhile` does not close this race at the cutover. It blocks events that the callback did
not start; it does not wait for an in-flight request, so that request resumes after the cutover and writes to
the old source. Around each local operation it would work, but it serializes every event on the object,
resets the object on a thrown error or after 30 seconds, and deadlocks on a self-RPC
([`blockConcurrencyWhile`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/state/#blockconcurrencywhile)).
The runtime does not use it outside its constructor.

Each operation and each host job declares one of three modes:

| Mode          | Contract on `local` / `runStep`                                           | Runtime action                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `"sync"`      | Returns a value. A thenable is a defect.                                  | Throws `fokos_local_must_be_sync` when the return is a thenable. No guard.      |
| `"lease"`     | Can await. Must go through the runtime for every partitioned write.        | Holds a shared lease across the call. Cutover takes the exclusive lease.        |
| `"unguarded"` | Can await. The host owns the safety of that choice.                       | None.                                                                          |

`"sync"` is the default. It is the FokosDB guideline, and the runtime enforces it: every FokosDB local
handler becomes a plain function, and an accidental `async` fails on the first call instead of leaving a race.
A `"sync"` read cannot return the source copy after a target has accepted a write, so the same rule covers
stale reads.

The lease is an in-memory counter and one promise. Rules:

- Shared acquisition never waits on other shared holders, so re-entrant use is safe. FokosDB stale-transaction
  recovery runs under a shared lease and calls `dispatch` for commit and cancel, which takes another shared
  lease.
- The cutover step of `source_repartition` takes the exclusive lease with writer preference: new shared
  requests wait once an exclusive request is pending, so a steady request stream cannot starve the cutover.
  It then runs `beforeCutover` and the cutover `transactionSync`, and releases. The wait is bounded by the
  longest in-flight `"lease"` operation, which delays cutover only, never a request.
- The runtime's own jobs never take the shared lease, because `source_repartition` performs the cutover.
- A restart clears the lease. Durable state is authoritative, so nothing is lost.

`"unguarded"` exists for a host that uses `blockConcurrencyWhile` inside its own handler, or for an operation
that cannot conflict with ownership. The runtime does not offer a `blockConcurrencyWhile` mode of its own.

#### 5.2.21 Performance

Common path, a point operation served locally: identity and topology compare (in memory, five scalar
fields), range config and policy compare (in memory, structural, bounded by the policy size, which for FokosDB is
about ten fields), lifecycle check (in memory), ownership check (one hash of the hash key per tree level, in memory),
override lookup (in-memory `Map`, one hash key), topology decision (in memory), one envelope allocation. No
storage read is added. A storage write happens only when the policy changed since the last request. Compared
with today, this removes the per-request `PromotionManager.statusFor` SQL query on hash partitions. Rows in
`fokos_route_overrides` are few per partition; the in-memory mirror costs about 100 bytes per promoted key.

Forwarded point operation: one extra RPC hop per uncached level. With warm caches a root reaches the serving leaf
in one hop. Napkin math: a Durable Object RPC in the same colo takes about 1 to 5 ms; across regions about 50 to
150 ms. A cold three-level path therefore costs three hops before caches warm. `TODO: measure` after
milestone 2 with the example host.

Group operations add one `Map` per destination and parallel remote calls. Scans add one RPC per intersecting
range child, as today.

Background: one alarm per partition, one pass per alarm. A pass with no due job costs one KV read and one
`getAlarm`.

#### 5.2.22 FokosDB adapter mapping

`PartitionDO` becomes a host. The table maps today's mechanisms to the new boundary.

| Stale-transaction recovery in `alarm`                           | Host job, `concurrency: "lease"` (it awaits the coordinator); `canRun` checks role and import state |

| `debugForcePromoteKey` queues on the called DO                  | Host RPC calls `runtime.requestPromotion`, which forwards to the owner (section 5.2.15) |

The transaction coordinator stores the root `FokosRouteContext` per participant, as it stores the context today.
It reads `policy.nsTx` and `policy.ns` for its bindings. Its participant list still does not change when the
tree changes.

**Public error codes do not change.** Runtime codes travel between partitions unchanged, because the runtime
matches on them across hops (section 5.2.7). `FokosDB` maps them to the existing public codes in
`withFokosErrors`, the wrapper every public method already runs, and keeps the runtime code in
`attributes.runtimeCode`:

| Runtime code                                     | Public code                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `fokos_importing`, `fokos_not_owner_yet`         | `partition_migrating`                       |
| `fokos_identity_mismatch`, `fokos_init_conflict` | `partition_context_mismatch`                |
| `fokos_out_of_range`                             | `partition_misrouted`                       |
| `fokos_not_initialized`                          | `range_partition_not_initialized`           |
| `fokos_single_owner_fallback`                    | `single_partition_fast_path_not_applicable` |
| `fokos_group_partial_failure`                    | `partition_fanout_failed`                   |

`db.ts` matches `single_partition_fast_path_not_applicable` inside the method body, before the wrapper maps the
error, so that match moves to `fokos_single_owner_fallback`. The coordinator matches only the host code
`partition_over_size`, which does not change.

#### 5.2.23 Deployment and rollback

The runtime ships as a separate entry of the `fokosdb` package or as its own package (open question 5.3.1).
FokosDB adopts it in milestone 5 as one change.

There is no backward compatibility with partitions that the current `PartitionDO` created. The runtime does not
read `__partition_context`, `__split_status`, `__split_migration_status`, `__split_migration_cursor`,
`__topo_cache`, `__partial_range_topology`, `promoted_keys`, or `range_hierarchy`, and there is no converter.
A deployment of the new code starts with fresh Durable Object namespaces or fresh shard groups. This removes
the legacy importer, the dual-write mirror hook, and the staged deployment that a compatible upgrade would need.

Rollback before milestone 5 is a revert of an unused package. Rollback after milestone 5 is a revert of the code
together with a return to the old namespaces; data written to the new namespaces is not readable by the old
code.

#### 5.2.24 Testing

- The example host from milestone 2 lives in the package tests. It imports nothing from FokosDB. A build guard
  like `check-client-bundle` in `packages/fokosdb/tsdown.config.ts` fails when the runtime entry reaches a
  module below `src/server/` or `src/shared/partition/`.
- Unit tests for the codec, the caches, arbitration, and both state machines move from the files in section 25
  of the audit with their cases intact.
- A property test checks that `belongsToTarget(key)` equals `resolveOwner(key).target` for every target of a
  plan, for random keys, for hash and range plans.
- Integration tests in the Workers runtime drive: hash split with a crash after `fokosInit`; target crash after
  `imported`; ack from a non-member; Bloom false positive on an uninitialized root and on an `awaiting_data`
  root; a promotion queued while a split is `queued`; a `scan` across three range children during import.
- Concurrency modes: a `"sync"` operation whose handler returns a promise fails with `fokos_local_must_be_sync`;
  a `"lease"` operation that awaits a `fetch` while `source_repartition` reaches its cutover step completes on the
  source before the cutover commits, and the next request for the same key routes to the target.
- The FokosDB suites listed in section 25 of the audit pass after milestone 5. Assertions that go through the
  `FokosDB` client keep their codes (section 5.2.22). Assertions that call a `PartitionDO` stub directly and
  expect `partition_migrating`, `partition_context_mismatch`, or `single_partition_fast_path_not_applicable`
  change to the runtime codes; nothing else in them changes. Helpers such as `TestPartition`,
  `triggerHashSplit`, and `withMigrationHeld` are rewritten over the runtime state.

### 5.3 Open Questions

#### 5.3.1 Package boundary

Options: a new entry `fokosdb/partition-runtime` in the existing package, or a separate npm package. A separate
package gives a clean dependency check and its own version. A new entry is less publishing work and shares the
build. The answer changes the build configuration only.

#### 5.3.2 One control RPC or named methods

Section 5.2.15 defines seven named `fokos*` methods plus `alarm`. The alternative is one `fokosRpc(request)`
method with a discriminated union of request kinds and a matching response union. One method means one line of
host boilerplate, one name that cannot collide, and no host change when a control operation is added. Named
methods give per-method types on the stub, no response matching, and a surface that the stub type documents.
A future base class hides the difference. The answer changes section 5.2.15 and the host example only.

#### 5.3.3 Bloom step for group operations

Today transaction routing skips the promotion Bloom filter. This design keeps that. A group operation could use it
and treat `fokos_not_owner_yet` and `fokos_not_initialized` on a speculative group as a per-group retry without
the Bloom step. The answer changes hop count for transactions on promoted keys only.

#### 5.3.4 Source cleanup for splits

The runtime supports `cleanupSourceStep` for every kind. FokosDB today keeps split source rows forever. The
FokosDB host can return `undefined` for splits and keep that behavior, or reclaim the rows. The answer is a FokosDB
decision, not a runtime one.

#### 5.3.5 Public ownership strategy

The hash and range strategies sit behind one internal contract. Publishing that contract lets a host bring a
different ownership model. It also freezes an API before a second implementation exists. The answer changes
nothing for FokosDB.

#### 5.3.6 Agents SDK scheduler adapter

The `FokosScheduler` interface (section 5.2.14) permits an adapter for a base class that owns the alarm. The
Agents SDK stores its own schedule and arms the alarm itself. The adapter must store the runtime deadline where
the SDK's alarm handler can see it, arm the earlier of the two, and call `runtime.runDueWork()` from the shared
handler. Whether the package ships that adapter or documents it as an example is open. `TODO: read the current
Agents SDK alarm and schedule API before the adapter is designed.`

#### 5.3.7 Re-entrant shared lease under writer preference

Section 5.2.20 states two rules that conflict. New shared requests wait once an exclusive request is pending,
so that a request stream cannot starve the cutover. A shared holder can call `dispatch`, which takes another
shared lease, and the text says this re-entrant use is safe. The sequence that breaks: a `"lease"` operation
holds the shared lease and awaits I/O; `source_repartition` requests the exclusive lease and waits; the holder
resumes and requests a nested shared lease, which waits behind the pending exclusive. Neither side proceeds.
The pass is single-flight (section 5.2.14), so every later pass waits on the stuck one and all background work
of the partition stops until eviction; the split never cuts over and the leaf reaches its size cap.

Exposure depends on a rule section 5.2.14 does not state: whether the jobs of one pass run sequentially. If they
do, the stale-transaction job and the cutover never overlap, and the only re-entrant path is a request-path
`"lease"` operation that calls `dispatch`, such as a `debugForceResolveTransaction` that commits or cancels
through routing. Options: track re-entrancy so that a nested acquisition of a current holder bypasses writer
preference; drop writer preference and bound the cutover wait with a deadline after which new shared requests
receive a retryable error; or forbid nested `dispatch` under `"lease"` and give the stale-transaction job a
runtime helper that commits and cancels without a second lease. The answer changes section 5.2.20 and the job
concurrency rule of section 5.2.14.

#### 5.3.8 Range split targets are not durable before `fokosInit`

Section 5.2.10 writes nothing durable at `start` step 1 and says a failed start's targets are reused by the
next start. That holds for a hash split, whose children are deterministic. A range split computes its
boundaries from live data on every attempt, and the source still accepts writes while `queued`, so a retry
after a partial init produces different child names. The children of the first attempt keep an identity and an
`awaiting_data` import record forever: they are not member rows, so every pull returns `fokos_target_unknown`
and reschedules, and they are not in `links`, so `walk` never destroys them. The same gap makes the check order
of `fokosMigrationPull` ambiguous: a member test before a state test returns `fokos_target_unknown` instead of
`fokos_not_owner_yet` when target rows are written only at cutover. Today's `runSplit` has the same orphan
behavior.

The takeover rule of section 5.2.15 answers one half of this question. A later plan that resolves the name of
an orphan takes the target over while its record is `awaiting_data`, so the orphan no longer makes that
partition unable to split. The orphan still polls its source and still stays outside `links` until a plan
claims it.

The likely fix is to persist the plan and the target rows in one `transactionSync` at step 1, before any
`fokosInit`, and reuse that plan on every retry, with `computeRangeBoundaries` called once per plan. The open
part is the trade-off: boundaries chosen at plan time drift while the source keeps accepting writes during a
long retry, and a plan that is abandoned needs a durable `abandoned` state and a way for its targets to learn
it. The answer changes the `start` rows of section 5.2.10 and steps 1 to 3 of section 5.2.12.

## 6. Examples

### 6.1 Point operation on a single key

A point operation routes to the single partition that owns `{ hashKey, sortKey }`.

#### Host Durable Object definition
```ts
// Inside constructor
this.fokos = new FokosPartitionRuntime({
	ctx,
	namespace: (routeCtx) => env[routeCtx.policy.ns] as DurableObjectNamespace,
	hooks: myHooks,
	operations: {
		findRecord: {
			shape: "point",
			whileMigrating: "retry",
			key: (req: FindReq) => ({ hashKey: req.hashKey, sortKey: req.sortKey }),
			local: (req: FindReq) => this.findRecordLocal(req),
			forward: (stub, target, req) => stub.findRecord(target, req),
		},
	},
});

// Exposed public RPC method
async findRecord(
	routeCtx: FokosRouteContext<MyPolicy>,
	req: FindReq,
): Promise<FokosEnvelope<FindRes>> {
	return this.fokos.dispatch("findRecord", routeCtx, req);
}
```

#### Worker invocation

```ts
const router = new FokosRouter(topology, policy);
const rootCtx = router.rootContext(req.hashKey);
const rootStub = env.MY_DO.getByName(rootCtx.doName);

const envelope = await rootStub.findRecord(rootCtx, req);
const { value, route } = router.unwrap(envelope);
```

### 6.2 Scan across all range partitions for a hash key

When a hash key is promoted into a range tree, child range partitions tile the interval `[start, end)`.
A `scan` shape walks every range partition that holds data for that hash key.

#### Host Durable Object definition

```ts
// Inside constructor
operations: {
	inspectHashKey: {
		shape: "scan",
		whileMigrating: "read_source",
		scan: (req: InspectReq) => ({
			hashKey: req.hashKey,
			start: null,
			end: null,
			descending: false,
		}),
		clip: (req, interval) => ({ ...req, start: interval.start, end: interval.end }),
		local: (req: InspectReq) => this.inspectLocal(req),
		forward: (stub, target, req) => stub.inspectHashKey(target, req),
		fold: (acc: InspectRes | null, part: InspectRes, req: InspectReq) => {
			const merged = { items: [...(acc?.items ?? []), ...part.items] };
			return { acc: merged, remaining: req };
		},
	},
}

// Exposed public RPC method
async inspectHashKey(
	routeCtx: FokosRouteContext<MyPolicy>,
	req: InspectReq,
): Promise<FokosEnvelope<InspectRes>> {
	return this.fokos.dispatch("inspectHashKey", routeCtx, req);
}
```

#### Worker invocation

The Worker sends the request to the root partition. The runtime traverses the range tree and collects results:
```ts
const router = new FokosRouter(topology, policy);
const rootCtx = router.rootContext(req.hashKey);
const rootStub = env.MY_DO.getByName(rootCtx.doName);

const envelope = await rootStub.inspectHashKey(rootCtx, req);
const { value } = router.unwrap(envelope);
```

### 6.3 Scan with early exit

A scan can stop traversal when a condition is met. Setting `remaining: null` in `fold` stops the walk immediately.

#### Host Durable Object definition

```ts
// Inside constructor
operations: {
	findFirstMatching: {
		shape: "scan",
		whileMigrating: "read_source",
		scan: (req: MatchReq) => ({
			hashKey: req.hashKey,
			start: req.start ?? null,
			end: null,
			descending: false,
		}),
		clip: (req, interval) => ({ ...req, start: interval.start }),
		local: (req: MatchReq) => this.matchLocal(req),
		forward: (stub, target, req) => stub.findFirstMatching(target, req),
		fold: (acc: MatchRes | null, part: MatchRes, req: MatchReq) => {
			if (part.foundItem) {
				return { acc: part, remaining: null };
			}
			return { acc: acc ?? part, remaining: req };
		},
	},
}

// Exposed public RPC method
async findFirstMatching(
	routeCtx: FokosRouteContext<MyPolicy>,
	req: MatchReq,
): Promise<FokosEnvelope<MatchRes>> {
	return this.fokos.dispatch("findFirstMatching", routeCtx, req);
}
```

#### Worker invocation

```ts
const router = new FokosRouter(topology, policy);
const rootCtx = router.rootContext(req.hashKey);
const rootStub = env.MY_DO.getByName(rootCtx.doName);

const envelope = await rootStub.findFirstMatching(rootCtx, {
	hashKey: req.hashKey,
	targetValue: "xyz",
});
const { value } = router.unwrap(envelope);
```

## 7. Alternative Options

**Base Durable Object class.** A `FokosPartitionDO` base class with protected hooks. Rejected as the primary
model because many hosts already extend another base class, for example the Agents SDK, and JavaScript has single
inheritance. The runtime can be wrapped by such a base class later.

**Class decorator or RPC dispatcher.** A decorator that wraps every public method with the pipeline. Rejected
because the shapes differ per operation and the decorator would need the same descriptor data; the explicit
`dispatch` call is one line and carries the descriptor name.

**Generated wrappers.** Code generation from a schema of RPC methods. Rejected for now: it adds a build step
and a schema language for a gain that the registry already gives.

**Topology-only extraction.** Move only `shared/partition-topology/` into a package. Rejected because the audit
shows that the sharding code depends on FokosDB rows for migration, boundaries, promotion, and cleanup. Without
the hook boundary the package cannot run a split.

**One RPC method per migrated record kind.** Keep three migration RPCs. Rejected because it forces the runtime
to know host record kinds and to persist one cursor per kind. One opaque page and one cursor remove both.

**Separate orchestrators for split and promotion.** Keep `SplitStateMachine` and `PromotionManager`. Rejected
because both need the same durable stages, the same acknowledgement retry, and the same arbitration. One table
makes the mutual exclusion atomic.

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions

**Why does the host register operations instead of passing closures per call?**
The runtime must run the host's local handler on a source partition when a target reads through during import.
It needs the handler by name. A registry also gives one place for the shape, the intent, and the signals.

**Why is `"sync"` the default instead of the lease?**
A synchronous handler has no yield point, so the race cannot happen and the guard costs nothing. Making the
strict mode the default turns the FokosDB guideline into a check the runtime performs. A host that needs an
`await` opts into `"lease"` for that one operation and keeps concurrency everywhere else. A
`blockConcurrencyWhile` mode is not offered: it would not drain an in-flight request at the cutover, and around
each local operation it would serialize the whole object and reset it on an error or after 30 seconds.

**Why is `importPage` synchronous?**
The runtime commits the page and the cursor in one `transactionSync`. SQLite and KV in Durable Objects are
synchronous, so a host import that writes storage needs no `await`. Atomic commit removes the case where the
page is applied and the cursor is lost.

**Why does the target keep a separate `imported` state?**
So that the acknowledgement can be retried after a crash. Today the child writes completion and then
acknowledges; a crash between the two leaves the parent split open forever.

**Why does the runtime reject pulls while the source is `queued`?**
Targets are created before cutover. A target's own fallback alarm can fire first. Exporting data before the
cutover is durable would let a target serve a key that the source still owns.

**Why does every request still carry topology and policy?**
A Durable Object has no other way to learn them. The constructor receives no parameters, and a library host
does not know at build time how many shard groups exist, how many roots each one has, or which binding name the
user chose. Carrying them lets the Worker decide per shard group and per tenant at run time, with no code in the
Durable Object. The cost is a few integers and one small object per request.

**How does a partition know the topology when a background job runs and no request is in flight?**
It stored the route context at bootstrap or `fokosInit`, and it replaces the range config and the policy parts
whenever a request carries a different value. Background jobs read the stored value through `runtime.routeContext()`.

**Why is the policy opaque instead of a typed set of thresholds?**
Different hosts need different policy. FokosDB needs two split condition sets and two binding keys. Another host
needs a row count or a tenant tier. The runtime only needs to store, compare, and forward the value.

**Does the host still see routing metadata in its responses?**
Yes, through `FokosEnvelope.route`. The host's own response type has no routing fields. FokosDB maps
`route.servedBy`, `hashDepth`, `rangeDepth`, and `forwardCount` into its public `PartitionInfo`.

**How does a host with no range partitions use the runtime?**
It omits `computeRangeBoundaries`, sets `promotionBloom: false`, and never returns `promotionCandidates`. Only
hash splits happen. The `scan` shape is unused.

**Why is `clip` needed in a scan operation, and how does it work?**
`clip(req: Req, interval: { start: KeyBytes | null; end: KeyBytes | null }): Req` restricts an opaque application request to the interval of one child partition. It is needed because:
1. **Application requests are opaque:** The runtime manages partition boundaries, but does not know the schema of `Req`.
2. **Boundary isolation:** When a query covers a range across multiple partitions, each partition must execute only for the slice of keys it owns.

The runtime finds the intersection between the query interval from `scan(req)` and the child partition interval `[start, end)`. It calls `clip(req, intersection)` to produce a child request, and forwards that request to the child partition. The child partition then executes `local` only on its owned keys.
