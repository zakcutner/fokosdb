## 1. Overview and context

### 1.1 The problem

`PartitionDO` moves ownership in three ways:

- A hash split moves all keys to hash children.
- A range split moves one sort-key interval to range children.
- A key promotion moves one hash key to a range root.

Each flow selects ownership, creates targets, changes routing, copies state, collects acknowledgements, and
cleans the source. The current code uses separate state models:

- Hash and range splits use the KV key `__split_status`. `SplitStateMachine` owns this key.
- Promotions use the SQL table `promoted_keys`. `PromotionManager` owns this table.
- Every target uses five KV keys. `SplitMigration` owns three of these keys.
- The source serves five migration RPCs.

The separate source models cannot arbitrate atomically. A split record and a promotion record can appear at the
same time. Limitation 24.7 of `docs/ideas/fokos-sharding/gptsol-existing-behavior.md` describes this race.

The same audit identifies related risks. The current code already retries target acknowledgements and routes a
forced promotion. M1 must preserve those fixes. It must also close these remaining gaps:

- Limitation 24.6: target import start is not durable.
- Limitation 24.15: an acknowledgement does not validate target membership.

`docs/ideas/fokos-sharding/2026-09-09-fokos-partition-runtime.md` specifies one repartition model and one import
loop. This RFC builds that durable model and protocol inside `PartitionDO`. A later change can move the code to
the runtime package.

FokosDB has no released durable data to convert. M1 therefore replaces the records in one deployment. This
option ends after the first release.

### 1.2 Current system

- One `PartitionDO` stores one partition in SQLite.
- A hash partition owns the keys that hash to its path.
- A range partition owns one hash key and one immutable `[startBoundary, endBoundary)` interval.
- Each request carries a `PartitionContextResolved` because a Durable Object has no constructor parameters.
- `ensurePartitionContext` validates the immutable identity and updates the mutable split policy.
- A split source becomes a router after cutover.
- A promotion source keeps all hash keys except the promoted key.
- An importing target rejects writes with `partition_migrating`.
- An importing target serves point and query reads through its source.
- `runBackgroundWork` and one alarm drive all background jobs.
- Durable transitions can update synchronous KV and SQL in one `ctx.storage.transactionSync` call.

## 2. Goals and requirements

### 2.1 In scope

- One SQL model must hold hash splits, range splits, and key promotions.
- One KV record, `__fokos/import`, must hold target import state.
- One arbitration transaction must decide each queue request and each cutover.
- Four control RPCs must replace the old initialization and migration RPCs.
- `fokosExecuteLocal` must replace both direct read RPCs.
- The target must persist `imported` before it acknowledges the source.
- The target must have its own fallback alarm.
- Each range split must persist one plan before it initializes a target.
- Each target must persist `pending`, `initializing`, or `initialized` on the source.
- A hash split and an unfinished key promotion must remain mutually exclusive.
- A terminal promotion must survive a later hash split.
- A promotion request after split cutover must route to the current hash child.
- An importing child must reject a promotion request until its import is complete.
- M0 must fix the three defects in section 4.13 before M1 replaces the durable records.
- The public `FokosDB` API and the transaction coordinator protocol must not change.
- Existing public error codes must not change.
- Existing integration assertions must continue to pass, except for replaced internal RPC names.

### 2.2 Out of scope

- The runtime dispatch pipeline, operation descriptors, response envelope, and lease modes are out of scope.
- Runtime package extraction and the example host are out of scope.
- The split of `PartitionContext` into identity, topology, and policy is out of scope.
- The KV keys `__partition_context` and `__partition_depth` must remain.
- A hash leaf ownership check is out of scope. Audit limitation 24.3 tracks it.
- A bound for learned range hierarchy rows is out of scope. Audit limitation 24.10 tracks it.
- Split source item reclamation is out of scope. Audit limitation 24.4 tracks it.
- A promotion cutover during a hash-child import is out of scope.
- Internal error renames from the runtime RFC are out of scope.
- An in-memory copy of `fokos_route_overrides` is out of scope.

### 2.3 Requirements

- Each durable transition must use one `ctx.storage.transactionSync` call with no `await`.
- SQL and KV records must decide protocol behavior.
- A cache must update after the transaction returns and before the next `await`.
- Each serialized RPC message must stay below the 32 MiB Workers RPC limit.
- Each migration page and each `fokosStatus` page must stay at or below 20 MiB.
- Each migration pull must scan at most 10,000 source rows.
- Each migration page must return at most 1,000 data rows.
- Each target import step must apply at most one migration page.
- Each source repartition step must select one repartition.
- `REPARTITION_RPC_CONCURRENCY` must be 6.
- Each source repartition step must call at most `REPARTITION_RPC_CONCURRENCY` targets.
- This bound matches the Workers limit of six simultaneous outgoing connections per request.
- Each KV key and value pair must stay below 2 MB.
- Each Durable Object must use its one alarm through `ensureAlarmSet`.
- Alarm scheduling must never replace an earlier deadline with a later deadline.
- Each background job must be idempotent, bounded, and resumable.
- `MAX_HASH_KEY_BYTES` must remain 1,024 bytes.
- `hashSplitN` and `rangeSplitN` must remain between 2 and 255.
- `splitN` values that affect deterministic routing must remain immutable after initialization.
- The partition must not retain every route override in an in-memory cache.
- `status()` must keep `splitStatus`, `migrationStatus`, and `promotedKeys` as a compatibility view for tests.
- `fokosStatus` must paginate all repartition and target rows.
- Destroy traversal must fence background work before it reads target links.
- Migration 3 of `sqlMigrations` must create the new tables in place.

## 3. Milestones

Each milestone must build, pass the existing suites, and be safe to ship on its own.

### M0 — Fix three current defects

M0 implements section 4.13. Each fix must start with a failing test.

M0 replaces `internalGetItemDirect` and `internalQueryItemsDirect` with `fokosExecuteLocal`. Its temporary
request has no repartition ID because the current source models have none. M1 adds the required ID. M0 also adds
`repartition_target_unknown` for a caller that fails membership validation.

The current source models authorize the caller during M0:

- A split source checks `splitStatus.childPartitionContexts`.
- A promotion source checks a `promoted_keys` row in `promoting`.
- A terminal override is a `promoted_keys` row in `promoted`.

### M1 — Replace the durable flow

M1 delivers the complete unified flow in one deployment. It includes:

- The three SQL tables and the plan KV records.
- The `__fokos/import` target record.
- Both state machines and the arbitration rules.
- The four control RPCs and `fokosExecuteLocal`.
- The phased migration cursor and bounded pull work.
- Single-flight background work and fair due-row selection.
- The derived `status()` view and paginated `fokosStatus`.
- A durable destroy fence and traversal over every durable target row.

M1 removes:

- `SplitStateMachine`.
- `PromotionManager`.
- `SplitMigration`.
- The old migration RPCs.
- `promoted_keys`.
- The old target migration KV keys.

## 4. Proposed solution

### 4.1 High-level overview

A **repartition** is one durable plan that moves ownership from one source to one or more targets.

- A `hash_split` moves all source keys to `hashSplitN` deterministic children. The source becomes a router.
- A `range_split` moves the source interval to `rangeSplitN` children. The source becomes a router.
- A `key_promotion` moves one hash key to its range root. The source keeps all other hash keys.

The source and target use separate durable state machines:

```text
source: fokos_repartitions.state

(none) -> queued -> planned -> cutover -> completed -> cleaned (promotions only)

Splits stop at completed.

target: __fokos/import.state

fokosInit -> awaiting_data --non-final page--> importing
                  |                              |
                  +---------final page----------+-> imported -> active
```

The source persists the plan and every target before it calls `fokosInit`. It persists `initializing` before
each initialization call. It changes routing only after every target is `initialized`.

Each target pulls three migration phases. It commits one page and its cursor atomically. The final page sets
`imported`. The target then retries the source acknowledgement until the source accepts it.

A split in `cutover` or `completed` makes its source a router. A key promotion in `cutover`, `completed`, or
`cleaned` makes its range tree the owner.

An unfinished promotion blocks a hash split. A hash split blocks each later promotion on its source. Terminal
promotions move to the owning hash child as route overrides.

### 4.2 Data model

Migration 3 in `packages/fokosdb/src/shared/partition/partition-store.ts` must create these tables. Migrations 4
and 5 must not change. `PartitionStore` must remain the only owner of their SQL statements.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS fokos_repartitions (
    id              TEXT    NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    seq             INTEGER NOT NULL,
    kind            TEXT    NOT NULL,
    state           TEXT    NOT NULL,
    hash_key        BLOB,
    cleanup_started INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    queued_at       INTEGER NOT NULL,
    cutover_at      INTEGER,
    completed_at    INTEGER,
    attempts        INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    next_attempt_at INTEGER NOT NULL
) STRICT;
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_fokos_repartitions_seq
    ON fokos_repartitions (seq);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_fokos_repartitions_due
    ON fokos_repartitions (state, next_attempt_at, seq);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_fokos_repartitions_split
    ON fokos_repartitions (kind) WHERE kind IN ('hash_split', 'range_split');

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS fokos_repartition_targets (
    repartition_id     TEXT    NOT NULL,
    partition_id       TEXT    NOT NULL,
    do_name            TEXT    NOT NULL,
    target_index       INTEGER NOT NULL,
    slice_kind         TEXT    NOT NULL,
    slice_hash_key     BLOB,
    slice_start        BLOB,
    slice_end          BLOB,
    slice_child_idx    INTEGER,
    initialization     TEXT    NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
    start_notified     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    acknowledged       INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    attempts           INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    next_attempt_at    INTEGER NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (repartition_id, partition_id),
    UNIQUE (repartition_id, target_index)
) STRICT;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS fokos_route_overrides (
    hash_key       BLOB NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    repartition_id TEXT NOT NULL
) WITHOUT ROWID, STRICT;
```

The valid values are:

- `kind`: `hash_split`, `range_split`, or `key_promotion`.
- `state`: `queued`, `planned`, `cutover`, `completed`, or `cleaned`.
- `initialization`: `pending`, `initializing`, or `initialized`.
- `slice_kind`: `hash_child`, `range`, or `promoted_key`.

The source creates local IDs as `r<seq>`. It gets `seq` from `MAX(seq) + 1`. Rows are permanent, so sequence
values do not repeat. The source `doName` and local ID form a global identity.

The slice uses SQL columns because migration filters and range routing read it. `target_index` defines target
order. Range partition IDs do not sort by boundary.

The key `__fokos/repartition/<id>/plan` stores the immutable plan with structured clone. The plan contains:

- The source identity.
- Computed range boundaries.
- Selected range ancestors.

The plan must not contain mutable split thresholds. Target rows already contain target references and slices,
so the plan must not repeat them.

The planning transaction must write the plan, all target rows, and `state = 'planned'`. A maximum-shape test
must use these limits:

- `rangeSplitN = 255`.
- Maximum hash and sort key sizes.
- The maximum 20 selected range ancestors.

The structured-clone value and its key must stay below 2 MB. The cutover transaction must delete the plan key.
All targets are initialized at that point, and target rows hold all routing slices.

The optional key `__fokos/repartition/<id>/cleanup` stores promotion cleanup progress. It can hold an opaque
cursor after runtime extraction. The final cleanup transaction must delete this key.

The boolean KV key `__fokos/destroying` is the durable destroy fence. Normal requests and background
transitions must stop when this value is true.

Each target stores one import record:

```ts
type FokosImportRecord = {
	schema: 1;
	state: "awaiting_data" | "importing" | "imported" | "active";
	repartitionId: string;
	source: PartitionContextLivePartition;
	slice: FokosSlice;
	cursor: FokosMigrationCursor | null;
	attempts: number;
	nextAttemptAt: number;
	updatedAt: number;
};

type FokosSlice =
	| { kind: "hash_child"; childIndex: number; depth: number }
	| { kind: "range"; hashKey: KeyBytes; start: KeyBytes | null; end: KeyBytes | null }
	| { kind: "promoted_key"; hashKey: KeyBytes };

type FokosMigrationCursor =
	| { phase: "overrides"; inner: PromotedKeyCursor | null }
	| { phase: "items"; inner: ScanCursor | null }
	| { phase: "pending_tx"; inner: PendingTransactionCursor | null };
```

A null import cursor means the start of the `overrides` phase. A null page cursor means that all phases are
complete.

The target stores the full source context to resolve the source namespace and name. The source validates only
the immutable `partitionId` and `doName` from control requests. It must not apply mutable policy from this
stored remote context.

The new records replace the old records as follows:

- `fokos_repartitions` and `fokos_repartition_targets` replace KV `__split_status`.
- `fokos_route_overrides` and `key_promotion` rows replace SQL `promoted_keys`.
- `__fokos/import.state` replaces KV `__split_migration_status`.
- `__fokos/import.cursor` replaces KV `__split_migration_cursor`.
- The `imported` state replaces KV `__split_migration_parent_ack_pending`.
- `__fokos/import.source` replaces KV `__parent_partition_context`.
- The source repartition kind replaces KV `__parent_split_type`.
- `completed`, `cleanup_started`, and `cleaned` replace `promoted_keys.gc_done`.
- The repartition states replace `promoted_keys.status`.

`PartitionStore.deleteExpiredItems` must check `fokos_route_overrides` instead of `promoted_keys`. The TTL
sweep must skip a hash key while any override row exists.

### 4.3 Source state machine

Durable SQL and KV records are authoritative. The source can cache its one split row and bounded split target
set. It must not load promotion rows or plans at startup.

A point override lookup must join `fokos_route_overrides` to its repartition row. A cache miss must read SQL.
Cache eviction must not change behavior.

The source transitions are:

- `queue`: Arbitration accepts a signal. Insert `queued`, `queued_at`, and a due deadline. Add a promotion
  override.
- `plan`: A `queued` row is due. Write the plan and targets, then set `planned`.
- `init_start`: At most six targets are due. Set `pending` targets to `initializing` before the RPCs.
- `init_done`: A `fokosInit` call succeeds. Set its target to `initialized` and reset retry fields.
- `cutover`: Every target is `initialized`. Recheck the guard. Set the state and `cutover_at`. Delete the plan.
- `start_import`: At most six targets are due. Advance retries before calls. Mark each success as `start_notified`.
- `ack`: A member target acknowledges. Mark it. Set `completed` and `completed_at` after the final acknowledgement.
- `cleanup`: A completed promotion has source rows. Persist progress and set `cleaned` after the final step.

The queue path must arm the fallback alarm before it writes a row. An alarm with no row is a safe no-op. A
repeated signal for an unfinished row must also restore a missing alarm.

The repartition kind determines its plan:

- A `hash_split` uses `resolveHashChildPartitionContexts`.
- A `range_split` computes boundaries once with `PartitionStore.computeRangeSplitBoundaries`.
- A `range_split` selects child ancestors once with `selectRangeAncestors`.
- A `key_promotion` uses `resolveRangePartitionContext(pCtx, hashKey, null, null)`.

When a range boundary query returns null, the repartition stays `queued` with no target rows. Its retry delay
starts at 5 seconds and doubles to a maximum of 5 minutes.

Before promotion initialization, the source must check that the key has no pending lock. A lock keeps the
target `pending`. The source retries this guard every 5 seconds. The cutover transaction must check the lock
count again.

A target in `initializing` means that an initialization call can be in flight or can have lost its reply. A due
retry must repeat the same idempotent `fokosInit` call.

The source must call at most six targets in one step. It must use `Promise.allSettled` so one failure does not
skip another selected target. A failed target keeps durable retry state. A successful target advances even when
another target fails.

A failed `fokosStartImport` must keep `start_notified = 0`. The source must retry it. The target alarm remains
the independent progress mechanism.

The source accepts local operations in `queued` and `planned`. A range plan can become unbalanced before
cutover. This does not change ownership coverage because the plan stores fixed intervals.

After the final split acknowledgement, the completion transaction must delete all source pending transaction
rows. The targets then hold the authoritative copies. A promotion must schedule bounded cleanup instead.

### 4.4 Arbitration

One `transactionSync` call must read all relevant rows and write each arbitration decision.

| Request                  | Acceptance rule                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Queue `hash_split`       | No split row exists, and no promotion is `queued`, `planned`, or `cutover`      |
| Queue `range_split`      | The source is a range partition, and no split row exists                        |
| Queue `key_promotion`    | The source is a hash partition, no split row exists, and the key has no override|
| Cut over a promotion     | No split row exists, its target is `initialized`, and the key has no lock       |
| Cut over a split         | Every target is `initialized`                                                   |

An unfinished promotion blocks a hash split. This keeps the current safety rule. It also removes the need for
a target cancellation protocol and a transaction-wide reservation for key-size bytes.

A lock can delay a promotion and its source hash split. The existing partition-level backpressure can then
reject new writes with `partition_over_size`. Reads, deletes, transaction commits, and cancels must remain
available. A `PREPARED` transaction must always be able to commit.

A hash split row in any state must block a promotion on that source. A split source in `cutover` or
`completed` is a router and owns no hash key.

Two promotions for different hash keys can progress at the same time. Fair due-row selection prevents one
failed promotion from starving another.

`debugForcePromoteKey` must use `routeSingleDestination`. After split cutover, it reaches the hash child that
owns the key. An importing child returns `partition_migrating` and creates no promotion row.

The existing signals remain:

1. A successful local write requests split evaluation.
2. A successful local put or committed transactional put can name a promotion candidate.
3. `debugForcePromoteKey` names a promotion candidate directly.

`TransactionParticipant` must not call an asynchronous promotion hook from a storage transaction. Its local
commit and single-shot methods must collect `{ hashKey, keyEstBytes }` results. `PartitionDO` must process the
deduplicated candidates after the item transaction returns. It must process promotion signals before split
evaluation.

The request result is fixed before post-write signal work starts. The durable queue write and alarm update must
be awaited. A failure must be logged and must not change the completed write result. Commit and single-shot
paths must catch this post-write failure because their item transaction already committed.

### 4.5 Target state machine

The target transitions are:

- `awaiting_data`: `fokosInit` writes identity, depth, ancestors, and the import record.
- `importing`: The target commits its first non-final page with the state and cursor.
- `imported`: The target commits the final page and a null cursor with this state.
- `active`: The source accepts the acknowledgement, and the target resets its retry fields.

The item phase must maintain `key_size_estimates` as section 4.7.2 specifies. This removes the unbounded final
`rebuildKeySizeEstimates` scan.

The target must persist `imported` before it calls the source. A crash or lost reply then causes another
acknowledgement attempt.

Each `fokosInit` call must restore the target fallback alarm before it returns. This rule also applies to an
idempotent retry. The alarm must start import when `fokosStartImport` does not arrive.

The request gate must apply these rules:

- In `awaiting_data` and `importing`, a supported read must use `fokosExecuteLocal` on the source.
- In `awaiting_data` and `importing`, every write or transaction RPC must fail with `partition_migrating`.
- A request to an incomplete target must request an earlier import step and restore the fallback alarm.
- In `imported` and `active`, local operations can run because data and locks are complete.
- TTL and stale transaction sweeps can run in `imported` and `active`.

A target in `imported` can serve requests before its acknowledgement succeeds. The source remains in a routing
state, and all target data is complete.

### 4.6 Control RPCs

The partition interface must include these types:

```ts
type FokosPartitionRef = {
	partitionId: string;
	doName: string;
};

type FokosInitRequest = {
	repartitionId: string;
	source: PartitionContextLivePartition;
	target: PartitionContextResolved;
	slice: FokosSlice;
	rangeDepth?: number;
	rangeAncestors?: RangeAncestorInfo[];
};

type FokosMigrationPullRequest = {
	repartitionId: string;
	target: FokosPartitionRef;
	cursor: FokosMigrationCursor | null;
	budgetBytes: number;
};

type FokosMigrationPage = {
	phase: "overrides" | "items" | "pending_tx";
	overrides?: { hashKey: KeyBytes }[];
	items?: MigratedItem[];
	pendingTransactions?: PendingTransactionRow[];
	deletionMetadata?: {
		maxDeleteTxOrderTs: number;
		deleteRevision: number;
	};
	nextCursor: FokosMigrationCursor | null;
};

interface FokosPartitionControlRpc {
	fokosInit(req: FokosInitRequest): Promise<void>;
	fokosStartImport(req: { repartitionId: string; source: FokosPartitionRef }): Promise<void>;
	fokosMigrationPull(req: FokosMigrationPullRequest): Promise<FokosMigrationPage>;
	fokosMigrationAck(req: { repartitionId: string; target: FokosPartitionRef }): Promise<void>;
	fokosExecuteLocal(req: FokosExecuteLocalRequest): Promise<GetItemRpcResponse | QueryItemsRpcResponse>;
}
```

Every control request must carry the immutable `partitionId` and `doName` of its remote participant. The
receiver must compare them with its durable rows. It must not trust a `doName` alone.

`fokosInit` must be idempotent for the repartition ID, source identity, target identity, and slice. A matching
retry must restore the alarm and return success in every import state. A mutable policy change must update the
stored target policy and source context. An immutable identity or slice conflict must throw
`partition_context_mismatch`. M1 has no target takeover protocol.

A hash partition can initialize from its first ordinary request. A range partition must initialize only through
`fokosInit`. The `range_partition_not_initialized` guard must remain.

`fokosStartImport` must compare the repartition and source with the import record. A mismatch must throw
`partition_context_mismatch`. A valid call schedules one import step in `awaiting_data` or `importing`. A
matching call in `imported` or `active` returns success.

`fokosMigrationPull` must check these rules in order:

1. The repartition must exist. Otherwise, throw `repartition_unknown`.
2. The target identity must match a target row. Otherwise, throw `repartition_target_unknown`.
3. The source state must be `cutover` or `completed`.
4. A pre-cutover source must throw `repartition_not_cut_over`.
5. A promotion with cleanup in progress must throw `partition_migrating`.
6. A cleaned promotion must throw `partition_migrating`.
7. The source must return one bounded page for the requested cursor.

`fokosMigrationAck` must apply the first two checks. It must accept a repeated acknowledgement in `cutover`,
`completed`, or `cleaned`. It must throw `repartition_not_cut_over` before cutover.

### 4.7 Migration phases

A **terminal override** has a repartition row in `completed` or `cleaned`. A hash split must export exactly the
terminal overrides in each target slice. Its item phase must exclude exactly those keys.

The phases run in this order:

1. `overrides`
2. `items`
3. `pending_tx`

#### 4.7.1 Overrides

Only a hash split returns override rows. The source must filter them by the hash-child slice and order them by
hash key.

For each imported override, the target must allocate a new local repartition sequence. It must atomically
create:

- A `key_promotion` row in `cleaned`.
- A range-root target row in `initialized`.
- `start_notified = 1` and `acknowledged = 1` on that target row.
- A route override for the hash key.

The page transaction must use one timestamp for `queued_at`, `cutover_at`, `completed_at`, and
`next_attempt_at`. It must set `cleanup_started = 1`, both attempt counts to zero, and `target_index = 0`.
Multiple rows in one page must receive consecutive local sequence values.

The inherited row needs no plan or cleanup key. The child has no source item for that key. The row exists for
routing, status, and destroy traversal.

A replay after a rolled-back page is safe because none of these records committed. A replay after a committed
page cannot apply because the import cursor advanced in the same transaction.

Other repartition kinds must return an empty override page and the next phase cursor.

#### 4.7.2 Items

The source must use the existing migration item queries and `collectBatch`. It must apply the target slice as
the filter.

A hash-child slice must exclude each terminal override key. The range tree owns those keys.

The target must insert each row with `insertItemIfAbsent`. The method must report whether it inserted the row
and its exact `est_row_bytes`. The page transaction must add inserted bytes to `key_size_estimates` by hash key.

#### 4.7.3 Pending transactions

The source must apply the same slice to `pending_transactions`. The target must use `insertPendingLock` and
`mergeDeletionMetadata` in the page transaction.

The source must include deletion metadata on every page in this phase. It must return one empty page with the
metadata when the slice has no pending row.

A promoted-key slice has no lock because promotion cutover requires a zero lock count. It still receives the
deletion metadata.

#### 4.7.4 Page bounds and cursor rules

Each page must contain one phase. The target must request 20 MiB. The source must cap a larger request at
20 MiB and reject a non-positive budget as an internal protocol error. Each page must obey these limits:

- At most 20 MiB by the existing conservative row estimators.
- At most 1,000 returned data rows.
- At most 10,000 scanned source rows.

The scan cursor must advance across excluded rows. A sparse target can therefore receive an empty page with a
non-null cursor. The target must continue from that cursor.

A phase that drains within the limits must return the next phase with `inner: null`. This transition costs one
extra RPC. The final `pending_tx` page must return `nextCursor: null`.

The target must validate the response phase against its requested cursor. It must reject a cursor that moves
backward or skips a phase before it starts the page transaction.

One target work step must pull and commit at most one page. It must not prefetch another page. This rule keeps
memory bounded and makes the durable cursor the only progress state.

### 4.8 Read-through and request routing

`fokosExecuteLocal` replaces `internalGetItemDirect` and `internalQueryItemsDirect`:

```ts
type FokosExecuteLocalRequest =
	| {
			op: "getItem";
			repartitionId: string;
			caller: FokosPartitionRef;
			request: GetItemRpcRequest;
	  }
	| {
			op: "queryItems";
			repartitionId: string;
			caller: FokosPartitionRef;
			request: QueryItemsRpcRequest;
	  };
```

The source must apply these rules in order:

1. Seek the repartition target by `(repartitionId, caller.partitionId)` and validate the complete caller identity.
2. Reject `queued` and `planned` with `repartition_not_cut_over`.
3. Reject a promotion after cleanup starts with `partition_migrating`.
4. Validate every requested key or interval against the caller slice.
5. For a promoted key from a hash-child caller, forward to the range root.
6. Otherwise, read the validated local slice without normal forwarding or lifecycle gates.

Slice validation must use the same helpers as migration and routing:

- A `hash_child` key must select the stated child and depth.
- A `range` key must match the hash key and `[start, end)` interval.
- A `promoted_key` key must match the stated hash key.
- A query interval must be clipped to the caller range.
- A point outside the slice must throw `partition_misrouted`.
- A disjoint interval must throw `partition_misrouted`.
- A cursor outside the clipped interval must throw `partition_misrouted`.

The direct local read must bypass source forwarding. The terminal-override exception must use normal
`apiGetItem` or `apiQueryItems` forwarding to the range root.

A hash target must replace the answer hash depth with its own depth. It must preserve the serving range
partition metadata when the source followed an override.

The request path must read the new records as follows:

- `shouldAllow` reads a split in `cutover` or `completed`.
- `pickChildPartition` and `walkRangeChildren` read targets in `target_index` order.
- `withSplitForwarding` and `groupItemsByRouting` use one joined override lookup.
- `ensureMigration` reads `__fokos/import.state`.
- `txPendingCanSweep` and `ttlCanSweep` read the import state and split router role.
- `HashPartitionTopologyImpl` reads a hash split in `cutover` or `completed`.

A router must build each forwarded context from its current context and the durable target slice. It must not
forward a stored mutable context.

A speculative range-root read must fall back on `repartition_not_cut_over`. The source still owns the key. A
write that reaches the same incomplete target must keep `partition_migrating` and must not fall back.

When `__fokos/destroying` is true, each normal request and control transition must fail with
`partition_migrating`. Status, prepare-destroy, and final destroy calls must remain available.

### 4.9 Cleanup, scheduling, and recovery

#### 4.9.1 Promotion cleanup

Only a key promotion cleans source item rows. One cleanup step must:

1. Set `cleanup_started = 1` in the first delete transaction.
2. Delete at most 1,000 item rows with `deleteItemsBatchForHashKey`.
3. Delete pending rows for the hash key with `deletePendingTxForHashKey`.
4. Delete the key-size estimate after the last item row.
5. Set the repartition to `cleaned`.

Hash and range split sources keep item rows. This keeps the current behavior from audit limitation 24.4.

#### 4.9.2 Single-flight work

`runBackgroundWork` must keep one in-memory in-flight promise. A timer, alarm, or request that arrives during a
pass must request one more pass after the current pass. Two passes must not interleave.

The in-memory promise is not durable progress. Every job must read its durable state before it writes. Each
background transition must stop when `__fokos/destroying` is true. A fenced pass must not schedule a timer or
alarm.

`fokosPrepareDestroy` must atomically validate an optional root context and set the fence. It must then wait for
the in-flight promise. A pass that resumes after a remote call must see the fence and make no transition. The
method must cancel the alarm after the pass stops. A repeated call must return success.

#### 4.9.3 Jobs

The jobs run in this order:

1. `target_import`: pull and apply at most one page.
2. `target_ack`: make one acknowledgement attempt.
3. `source_repartition`: advance one due repartition by one bounded step.
4. `source_cleanup`: delete one batch for one completed promotion.
5. Stale transaction recovery.
6. TTL expiry.

`source_repartition` must select one due row by `(next_attempt_at, seq)`. A failed row moves to a later
deadline. Another due row can then run. `source_cleanup` must use the same order for completed promotions and
must move an incomplete cleanup to a later deadline.

Within the selected repartition, initialization and start notifications must select at most six due targets.
A step must attempt all six selected targets and record each result. The repartition `next_attempt_at` must equal
the earliest deadline of work that its targets still need. Each target result must update this value atomically.

#### 4.9.4 Retry policy

The source uses these retry delays:

- A lock-blocked promotion: 5 seconds with no backoff.
- A range plan with no boundaries: exponential from 5 seconds to 5 minutes.
- A target initialization or start failure: exponential from 5 seconds to 5 minutes.
- An incomplete promotion cleanup: 5 seconds.

The target uses these retry delays:

- `repartition_not_cut_over`: 10 seconds with no backoff.
- Any other retryable import or acknowledgement error: exponential from 10 seconds to 5 minutes.

A successful step must reset its attempt count. A new durable work item must start due now. A non-retryable
protocol error must keep the state, log the complete identifiers, and retry no sooner than 5 minutes.

Each failed step must log the repartition ID, target identity, phase, cursor, attempt count, and next deadline.

#### 4.9.5 Alarm

After a work pass checks the destroy fence, it must arm a future fallback before it mutates state or awaits an
RPC. A crash must leave an alarm that can read the new durable state. After the pass, the alarm must move to
the earliest durable deadline from:

- An import in `awaiting_data`, `importing`, or `imported`.
- A source repartition in `queued`, `planned`, or `cutover` with an unnotified target.
- A target row in `pending` or `initializing`.
- A completed promotion that needs cleanup.
- An unguarded pending transaction.

A completed split and a cleaned promotion need no repartition alarm.

The alarm handler must catch job errors and set a new durable deadline. Cloudflare retries a thrown alarm only
six times, so correctness must not depend on those automatic retries.

### 4.10 Concurrency and invariants

A Durable Object has one JavaScript thread, but requests interleave at `await` points.

These rules prevent ownership races:

1. Each transition uses one synchronous storage transaction.
2. Durable state is authoritative.
3. A local mutation has no `await` between owner resolution and its write.
4. Target initialization writes `initializing` before the RPC.
5. One background pass runs at a time.
6. A page transaction checks the repartition ID, import state, and expected cursor.
7. Recovery uses public `txCommit` and `txCancel` methods.
8. Cancel attempts every destination and rethrows after any child failure.

The mechanisms hold these invariants:

- A split router never serves its local item copy. `shouldAllow` forwards in `cutover` and `completed`.
- The source owns data before cutover. Pull and read-through reject `queued` and `planned`.
- Routing and migration use one ownership function. Both derive it from the durable target slice.
- A query does not read a sibling range. Each router and source clips the interval.
- Every target acknowledges before completion. Ack checks membership and counts target rows.
- A normal write does not change an incomplete target. The import gate rejects it before `imported`.
- A promoted-key read reaches the range tree. Overrides migrate first, and read-through follows them.
- Each migration step is bounded and durable. One bounded page commits with its cursor.
- A pre-split lock moves to its owner. The `pending_tx` phase completes before `imported`.
- A promotion does not move a locked key. The source checks before init and during cutover.
- A terminal promotion survives a hash split. The child receives its override and no item copy.
- A decided transaction can always commit. Commit keeps `ignore_size_reject`.
- Failed work keeps durable progress. Each job persists a guarded step and retry deadline.

The `items` table must continue to hold committed rows only. Migration copies committed item rows and separate
pending lock rows. It must not combine them.

### 4.11 Failure recovery

The flow recovers as follows:

- The source stops after `initializing`: a due pass repeats the same `fokosInit`.
- A `fokosInit` reply is lost: the idempotent retry restores the target alarm.
- The source stops after cutover: each target starts from its own alarm.
- The target stops during import: it resumes from the committed cursor.
- The target stops after `imported`: `target_ack` retries.
- The source cannot accept an acknowledgement: the imported target continues to serve and retry.
- A range split stops after partial initialization: its durable plan and target states remain.
- A pull reaches the source before cutover: the target retries `repartition_not_cut_over`.
- A promotion key has a lock: its target stays `pending`.
- A lock appears during initialization: the promotion cutover guard fails.
- One selected target RPC fails: other calls finish, and only failed targets retry.
- One repartition keeps failing: its later deadline lets another due row run.
- An alarm job fails: it records another deadline before the alarm handler returns.
- Destroy starts during a target RPC: the durable target row exists, and the fence waits for the source pass.
- A cache misses or evicts an entry: the caller reads SQL and KV.

### 4.12 Status, destroy, errors, performance, and deployment

#### 4.12.1 Compatibility `status()`

`status()` must derive its existing fields from the new records:

- `splitStatus`: `queued` and `planned` map to `split_queued`.
- `splitStatus`: `cutover` maps to `split_started`.
- `splitStatus`: `completed` maps to `split_completed`.
- `migrationStatus`: `awaiting_data` maps to `migration_initialized`.
- `migrationStatus`: `importing` maps to `migration_migrating`.
- `migrationStatus`: `imported` and `active` map to `migration_completed`.
- `promotedKeys`: `queued` and `planned` map to `queued`.
- `promotedKeys`: `cutover` maps to `promoting`.
- `promotedKeys`: `completed` and `cleaned` map to `promoted`.
- `parentPartitionContext` comes from `__fokos/import.source`.
- The source kind derives `parentSplitType` and `splitType`.
- `createdAt` uses `queued_at`, `cutover_at`, or `completed_at` for its mapped split state.
- `migratedChildDoNames` comes from acknowledged split targets.
- `history` is the derived list of earlier mapped split states.
- `partitionContext` uses the source's current context.

Split target contexts must use `target_index` order and the source's current mutable context.

#### 4.12.2 Paginated `fokosStatus`

M1 must add this bounded administration view:

```ts
type FokosStatusCursor = {
	seq: number;
	targetIndex: number;
};

type FokosStatusEntry = {
	repartition: {
		id: string;
		seq: number;
		kind: "hash_split" | "range_split" | "key_promotion";
		state: "queued" | "planned" | "cutover" | "completed" | "cleaned";
	};
	target: null | {
		index: number;
		ref: FokosPartitionRef;
		initialization: "pending" | "initializing" | "initialized";
		acknowledged: boolean;
	};
};

type FokosStatusPage = {
	initialized: boolean;
	destroying: boolean;
	partitionContext: PartitionContextLivePartition | null;
	importState: FokosImportRecord["state"] | null;
	entries: FokosStatusEntry[];
	nextCursor: FokosStatusCursor | null;
};

type FokosStatusRequest = {
	cursor: FokosStatusCursor | null;
	rootContext?: PartitionContextResolved;
};

interface FokosPartitionStatusRpc {
	fokosPrepareDestroy(req: { rootContext?: PartitionContextResolved }): Promise<void>;
	fokosStatus(req: FokosStatusRequest): Promise<FokosStatusPage>;
	destroyPartition(): Promise<void>;
}
```

Each page must:

- Order entries by `(seq, target_index)`.
- Use `targetIndex = -1` for a repartition that has no target.
- Represent that repartition as one entry with `target: null`.
- Return at most 1,000 entries.
- Use a conservative serialized-byte estimator and stay at or below 20 MiB.
- Resume strictly after the cursor.

Diagnostic pages can reflect transitions that occur between calls. Destroy traversal sets the fence first, so
its pages read a stable link set.

A root status request can carry its root context for bootstrap. A target status request must omit it. The target
request must not initialize an empty partition. It must return `initialized: false`, an empty entry list, and a
null cursor.

`traverseForDestroy` must apply this sequence to each partition:

1. Call `fokosPrepareDestroy`. Pass a context only when it bootstraps a root.
2. Read every `fokosStatus` page after the fence is active.
3. Walk each target before it destroys the source.
4. Deduplicate target `doName` values across the full traversal.
5. Call `destroyPartition` after all target calls finish.

A `pending` target has received no initialization call and is a leaf. An `initializing` target can be empty or
initialized. Traversal must fence it, then check its status without a root context. An uninitialized target must
be destroyed as a leaf.

This traversal must include `pending`, `initializing`, and `initialized` target rows. Pagination must prevent an
unbounded promotion count from blocking destroy. The fence must prevent a source from adding a target after
traversal reads its final page.

#### 4.12.3 Errors

M0 adds `repartition_target_unknown` as a non-retryable `FokosInternalError`. The target is not a member.

M1 adds two more internal codes in `packages/fokosdb/src/shared/errors.ts`:

- `repartition_not_cut_over` is a retryable `FokosUnavailableError`. The source still owns the slice.
- `repartition_unknown` is a non-retryable `FokosInternalError`. The repartition does not exist.

A speculative read must fall back on `repartition_not_cut_over`. If this code reaches the public root,
`withFokosErrors` must map it to `partition_migrating`. The mapped error must keep the internal code in
`attributes.runtimeCode` and keep the original `error_id`.

#### 4.12.4 Performance

A point operation on a hash partition performs one indexed override join. This matches the current
`PromotionManager.statusFor` SQL lookup.

A source keeps only its split row and at most 255 split targets in memory. Promotion rows remain in SQL. Each
production promotion query must use an index and a bounded result. The test-only `status()` compatibility view
keeps its current unbounded shape.

Migration adds one RPC for each phase transition. It uses one data RPC for each bounded page. One alarm pass
applies at most one page per target.

#### 4.12.5 Deployment and rollback

M0 uses the current durable records. A code revert can roll it back.

M1 has no compatibility with records from the current implementation. Deployment must use fresh Durable Object
namespaces or fresh table names. M1 replaces source and target records in one deployment.

An M1 rollback needs the old code and the old namespace. It cannot read M1 records.

### 4.13 Defects that M0 must fix

#### D1 — Concurrent import loops can restore deleted state

`scheduleBackgroundWork` releases its marker after 1 second while work can still run. An alarm can start a
second `SplitMigration` loop.

Failure sequence:

1. Loop A imports a page and finishes the import.
2. A user deletes an imported item on the active target.
3. Loop B commits an older page that it already holds.
4. `INSERT OR IGNORE` restores the deleted item because the row is absent.

The same sequence can restore a pending lock.

M0 must use one in-memory import promise. Each page transaction must recheck the durable migration state. An
item page must also check its expected durable cursor. M1 applies the cursor check to every phase.

#### D2 — A promoted-key read through an importing hash child can use stale source rows

The current read-through calls the parent direct-read RPC before it resolves promotions. A hash split imports
promoted-key metadata after item rows.

Failure sequence:

1. Hash leaf L promotes key K.
2. L later splits and creates child C.
3. A cache routes a read of K to C during import.
4. C reads K from L's local item rows.
5. Promotion cleanup can make those rows stale or absent.

M0 must use `fokosExecuteLocal`. The source must validate the caller and follow a terminal promotion override.
M1 must also import overrides before item rows.

#### D3 — A range router forwards stale mutable policy

`SplitStateMachine` stores full child contexts at split time. The range router later forwards those stored
contexts. A child can then replace new split thresholds with old values.

M0 must build each forwarded child context from the router's current context and the stored immutable
boundaries.

### 4.14 Testing

The replaced unit suites must move to the new source state, arbitration, and import components. They must keep
their current cases.

The harness changes are:

- `withMigrationHeld` must hold `fokosMigrationPull` in the `pending_tx` phase.
- `withMigrationBatchCap` must cap each phase of `fokosMigrationPull`.

M0 and M1 must add integration tests for these behaviors:

- A stale import step cannot restore a deleted item or pending lock.
- Promoted-key point and query reads through an importing hash child reach the range tree.
- A range router forwards its current mutable context.
- One import pass applies at most one page.
- Item page retries keep exact key-size estimates without a final full-table scan.
- An empty page with a non-null scan cursor resumes correctly.
- A pull scans at most 10,000 source rows.
- A target in `imported` retries its acknowledgement after restart.
- Idempotent `fokosInit` restores a deleted alarm.
- A repeated source signal restores a deleted alarm.
- A target starts without `fokosStartImport`.
- A conflicting `fokosInit` cannot replace an import.
- An unknown target cannot pull, read through, or acknowledge.
- A lock-blocked promotion prevents a hash split.
- A terminal promotion survives a hash split.
- The owning child receives the override and no item copy.
- A promotion cannot queue after a hash split exists.
- A forced promotion routes to the current owner.
- A forced promotion during child import creates no row.
- A retry after child import queues the promotion on that child.
- A Bloom false positive before cutover falls back for reads only.
- A range split reuses its plan after partial initialization.
- A broad query is clipped to one importing range child.
- A cursor outside the target slice fails.
- A maximum-shape range plan fits the KV limit.
- `repartition_not_cut_over` maps to `partition_migrating` at the public root.
- Cache eviction does not change routing.
- One failed promotion does not starve another due promotion.
- One failed target RPC does not skip another selected target.
- Destroy reaches every target state through paginated status.
- A destroy fence waits for an in-flight target RPC and prevents another transition.
- Each `fokosStatus` page stays within both page limits.
- A 100 MB migration benchmark records the before-M1 and after-M1 results.

Existing transaction tests must continue to prove:

- `PREPARED` always commits.
- Commit and cancel bypass size rejection but still route.
- Cancel attempts all child destinations and reports a partial failure.
- Recovery uses public commit and cancel paths.

## 5. Alternative options

### 5.1 Keep the two source state models

This option cannot make split and promotion arbitration atomic. It also adds retry and membership fields to both
models. It produces most of M1 without removing duplicate code.

### 5.2 Build the runtime package first

The runtime RFC has earlier package and dispatch milestones. Its durable repartition work arrives later. The
pre-release schema window can close before that work completes.

### 5.3 Convert current records

No released deployment needs conversion. Fresh namespaces or table names make a converter unnecessary.

### 5.4 Keep one RPC for each migration record type

Three pull RPCs need three cursors and three authorization paths. One phased cursor uses one path. It costs one
small RPC at each phase transition.

### 5.5 Store each target slice as one BLOB

The runtime RFC uses a BLOB because its runtime does not query inside a slice. M1 filters migration rows and
orders range children in SQL. Columns support both operations.

### 5.6 Let a hash split abandon a pending promotion

This option needs a durable cancellation fence once target initialization can start. It also needs exact
per-hash-key size reservations across concurrent prepares. Without reservations, several accepted transactions
can exceed a key cap before commit.

A copied hot key can also cause repeated hash splits before its next promotion. Keeping mutual exclusion avoids
these states and preserves current behavior.

### 5.7 Prefetch one migration page

Two 20 MiB serialized pages can have more than 40 MiB of live decoded data. A Workers isolate has 128 MB of
memory. Prefetch also adds a second cursor identity and stale-page handling. M1 uses one page at a time.

## 6. Frequently asked questions

### Does a client see a change?

No. Public methods, public error codes, and the transaction coordinator protocol do not change. A write to an
importing target still fails with `partition_migrating`.

### Why does `status()` keep its old fields?

The existing partition tests use those fields. The derived view keeps those tests useful during M1.

### Why use `fokos*` RPC names now?

M1 replaces the complete internal wire protocol. The names match the later runtime package and need no second
migration.

### Can an imported target start its own repartition before its acknowledgement succeeds?

Yes. The `imported` state has complete data and locks. Its target acknowledgement continues as a separate job.
The partition can be a target of one repartition and the source of another.

### Can a promotion cut over while its hash child imports?

No. The migration gate rejects the promotion request. The caller can retry after import completes.

### Why does a lock-blocked promotion also block a hash split?

A split cannot move or abandon an initialized promotion without a cancellation fence. The current system also
keeps these flows mutually exclusive. This RFC keeps that rule and fixes its atomicity.

### Why does scheduling use the earliest due row?

A random order can scan the eligible set and has no starvation bound. Ordering by `(next_attempt_at, seq)` uses
an index. A failed row moves behind another due row.
